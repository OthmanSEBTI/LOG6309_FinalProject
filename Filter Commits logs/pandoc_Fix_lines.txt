Fixed delimited code blocks:  eat blank lines afterwards, and allow end line to contain more tildes than beginning line.
Fixed bug in RST reader, which would choke on: "p. one\ntwo\n". Added some try's in ordered list parsers.
RST reader: Fixed bug in parsing explicit links (resolves Issue #44). The problem was that we were looking for inlines until a '<' character signaled the start of the URL.  So if you hit a reference-style link, it would keep looking til the end of the document.  Fix:  change inline => (notFollowedBy (char '`') >> inline).  Note that this won't allow code inlines in links, but these aren't allowed in resT anyway.
Fixed markdown reader to handle "*hi **there***" as a strong nested in an emph. (A '*' is only recognized as the end of the emphasis if it's not the beginning of a strong emphasis.)
Fixed bug in the markdown reader:  HTML preceding a code block could cause it to be parsed as a paragraph.  (The problem is that the HTML parser used to eat all blank space after an HTML block, including the indentation of the code block.)  Resolves Issue #39. + In Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML, removed parsing of following space   from rawHtmlBlock. + In Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown, modified rawHtmlBlocks so that   indentation is eaten *only* on the first line after the HTML   block.  This means that in   <div>        foo   <div>   the foo won't be treated as a code block, but in   <div>
HTML reader:  Finished fixing Issue #40. Contents of script tags were still being treated as markdown when the script tags were parsed as inline.  Fixed by moving "script" from the list of tags that can be either block or inline to the list of block tags.
Fixed bug in HTML reader:  it was looking for <IT> tag, not <I>.
Fixed handling of email addresses in markdown and reStructuredText. Consolidated uri and email address parsers.  (Resolves Issue #37.) + New emailAddress and uri parsers in Text.Pandoc.Shared.   uri parser uses parseURI from Network.URI.  emailAddress   parser properly handles email addresses with periods in them. + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST. + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown.
Fixed small error in testsuite.native.
Fixed some haddock documentation bugs in Shared.hs.
Fixed logic in markdown smart quote parsing: + Added some needed 'try' statements. + Unicode right single-quote can double as apostrophe, so treat it   as a quote-end only when not followed by an alphanumeric character.
Fixed smart quote parsing in markdown reader so that unicode characters 8216 and 8217 are recognized as single quotes, and 8220 and 8221 as double quotes.
Fixed bug in LaTeX reader (pointed out by Mark Eli Kalderon): needed a "try" before "string" in parser for \[ math blocks.
Fixed bug in parsing files that begin with blank lines. + In Text.Pandoc.Shared: rewrote lineClump to parse EITHER a string   of blank lines OR a string of nonblanks.  Removed code for parsing   eof. + In Markdown and RST readers, use 'manyTill (... <|> lineClump) eof'   instead of many, since lineClump no longer parses eof.
Improvements to RST reader: + Allow field lists to be indented. + Parse the contents of field lists instead of treating them as   raw strings. + Represent field lists as definition lists rather than blockquotes. + Fixed bug in which metadata would be overridden if the document   contained more than one field list. + Parse fields associated with ..image: blocks, and use the 'alt'   field, if present, for image alt text and title.
Fixed bug in RST reader:  previously, code blocks had to be indented a full tabstop, but RST allows any amount of indentation. Resolves Issue #27.
Fixed bug in markdown writer:  If an ordered list item began with a marker greater than 3 characters in width, and the item took more than one line, it would appear on the line after the list marker, e.g.:
Fixed a bug in the Markdown writer:  incorrect line wrapping in paragraphs including hard line breaks.  Resolves Issue #25.
Fixed macports Portfile: + Do installation manually rather than using Makefile's install-all.   (There appears to be a problem with the Makefile's handling of   DESTDIR.) + Note that the library must be registered in the activate phase, after   the library files have been copied out of the destroot.  Cabal   generates a 'register.sh' script that will do this.
Fixed URL regex in html2x.pl, and added a command to the pipe to truncate input pages to 100K.
Fixed two bugs in HTML reader: + <code>...</code> not surrounded by <pre> should count as   inline HTML, not code block. + parser for minimized attributes should not swallow trailing spaces
+ Fixed bug in RST writer's handling of ordered lists.  Previously,   list items with multiple lines would not always line up with single-line   list items.  Now, list items are nested the length of the list marker + 1.   This looks better and ensures that list items all line up.  (Note that   list markers are padded to the length of the longest list marker in the   series.) + Use 3-space indent for unordered lists.
Fixed CSS for website so headers linked back to TOC don't have lines under them.
Fixed formatting mistakes in 0.43 news on website.
Fixed bug in LaTeX reader, which wrongly assumed that the roman numeral after "enum" in "setcounter" would consist entirely of "i"s.  enumiv is legitimate.
+ Fixed bug introduced into referenceTitle by previous changes.   Now it works as before. + Improved Markdown.pl-compatibility in referenceLink:  the two   parts of a reference-style link may be separated by one space,   but not more... [a] [link], [not]   [a link].
Fixed markdown inline code parsing so it better accords with Markdown.pl:  the marker for the end of the code section is a clump of the same number of `'s with which the section began, followed by a non-` character.  So, for example,
Fixed bug in LaTeX writer:  autolinks would not cause '\usepackage{url}' to be put in the document header. Also, changes to state in enumerated list items would be overwritten.
Separated $(web_dest) and website targets. Fixed a bug in index.txt.in.
Fixed bug in LaTeX writer.  When a footnote ends with a Verbatim environment, the close } of the footnote needs to occur on the same line or an error occurs.  Fixed by adding a newline before the close } in every footnote.
+ Fixed bug in markdown ordered list parsing.  The problem was   that anyOrderedListStart did not check for a space following the   ordered list marker. So, 'A.B. 2007' would be parsed as a list item,   then fail because of the lack of space after 'A.' (required by   orderedListStart). Resolves Issue #22. + Fixed a similar problem in RST reader. + Added regression test.
Fixed block quote output in markdown writer:  previously, block quotes in notes would be indented only in the first line.
Fixed bug in tarball target in Makefile (should be RELNAME instead of fullname).
Fixed bug in normalizeSpaces:  Space:Str "":Space should compress to Space.
Fixed problems with obfuscateLink introduced by last round of changes.  Changed type so that text parameter is String, not HTML, which allows easier testing for autolinks.
Fixed a bug in Docbook writer:  email links with text were being incorrectly treated as autolinks.
Fixes in LaTeX writer: + put \VerbatimFootnotes right before \title block, to avoid   bad interactions. + added deVerb in description list. + removed \texttt{} from deVerb, because it cannot go in description   lists.
Fixed bug in TOC generation in HTML writer (regression, introduced by the revision in the WriterState type).
Fixed bug in spanStrikeout:  case was not exhaustive.
Fixed newline issue at end of man page writer test.
Text.Pandoc.Blocks: + Fixed a bug in hPad, which previously padded the rightmost   cell.  This is fixed by introducing a case for a singleton   list. + Fixed Markdown writer so that the space after a table is not   nested two spaces. + Adjusted Markdown table tests accordingly.
Markdown writer: Fixed a small problem with lengths of dashed lines in tables.
Fixed bug in Notes ($$ instead of <>), which caused note blocks to be indented.
HTML writer modifications: + Added code to HTML Writer to generate a table of contents if the   writerTableOfContents option is specified.  This is an unordered list   with links to the headers.  It is constructed hierarchically, based on   the order of the headers and their levels. + If a TOC is used, the headers become links back to the TOC. + Removed Toc from WriterState; instead, the TOC is generated at the top   level, by the function tableOfContents. + Fixed a bug in uniqueIdentifiers which prevented it from handling more than   one duplicate.
Fixed bug in Markdown reader:  links in footnotes were not being processed.  Solution:  three-stage parse.  First, get all the reference keys and add information to state.  Next, get all the notes and add information to state.  (Reference keys may be needed at this stage.)  Finally, parse everything else.
Fixed bug with indented blocks occurring in definition lists.
Fixed bug in anyLine parser.  Previously anyLine would parse an empty string "".  But it should fail on an empty string, or we get an error from its use inside "many" combinators.
Fixed export declarations; removed unneeded import of Pandoc.Shared.
Fixed bug in email obfuscation (issue #15). If the text to be obfuscated contains an entity, this needs to be decoded before obfuscation. Thanks to thsutton for the patch.
Fixed bug in HTML email obfuscation using --strict mode. The problem is that the "href" function escapes &, so (href "&#108;") is 'href="&amp;#108;"'.  Fixed by using primHtml for the whole link.  Resolves issue 9.
Fixed bug in noscript part of email obfuscation: & instead of &amp;
Fixed issue #8:  slow performance in parsing inline literals in RST reader.  The problem was that ``#`` was seen by 'inline' as a potential link or image.  Fix:  insert 'notFollowedBy (char '`')' in link parsers.
Fixed bug in 'extractTagType' in HTML reader:  previous version was not skipping / in close tags.
Fixed a bug in extractTagType in HTML Reader:  the previous version extracted the attributes, too, which is not wanted.
Fixed bug in HTML attribute parser:  now a space is required before an attribute.  Previously, <a.b> would be parsed as an HTML tag with an attribute!
Fixed bug in smart quoting:  recognize ' in contractions like "don't" as not beginning single quoted contexts.
Fixed bug in smart quote recognition:  ' before ) or certain other punctuation must not be an open quote.
Fixed haddock documentation errors.
Fix debian/changelog.
Fixed docbook writer test -- removed named entities.
+ Fix a nasty bug in markdown2pdf.  It used to send the log file to   /dev/null!
Fixed performance problems with '--strict' option: + Replaced skipEndline with "option ' ' newline" where possible. + Replaced "notFollowedBy' header" in definition of endline with   a faster but equally accurate test for a folliwng header. + Removed check at the beginning of 'reference' for   a noteStart: This is not needed, because note comes before   referenceKey in the definition of block. + Replaced check for a following anyHtmlBlockTag in autoLink   with a check for anyHtmlTag or anyHtmlEndTag. + Other small code cleanups.
Fixed bug in Markdown reader's handling of underscores and other inline formatting markers inside reference labels:  for example, in '[A_B]: /url/a_b', the material between underscores was being parsed as emphasized inlines.
Fixed formatting in pandoc man page.
Fixed serious performance problems with new Markdown reader: Instead of using lookahead to determine whether a single quote is an apostrophe, we now use state.  Inside single quotes, a ' character won't be recognized as the beginning of a single quote.  'stateQuoteContext' has been added to keep track of this.
Fix the bug in 'install-all' target which does not install the wrappers. (This target is somewhat special as it should handle installing and _registering_ the library in generic installations.)  We can't rely on 'install-exec' to fix this bug (but we should depend on 'build-exec' nevertheless), since the 'install-all' target already installs pandoc along with the library files.  Therefore we should install wrappers separately by using a helper function which was specifically created to avoid code duplication ('install-exec' target was also updated so as to use this function).
Fix the wrapper usage instruction in INSTALL.
Fixed small bug in consolidateList:  added case for (Str a):Space:Space:rest.
Fixed bug in encodeEntities (characters less than 128, not 127, should be encoded).
Fixed a bug in website generation, which only worked if 'pandoc' and the wrappers had been installed.
Fix the version of Debian packages, it should be "0.3" now.
+ Added regression tests with footnotes in quote blocks and lists. + This uncovered an existing bug in the RTF writer, which got indentation   wrong on footnotes occuring in indented blocks like lists.  Fixed   this bug.
Fixed a serious bug in the Markdown reader (also affecting LaTeX and RST readers).  The problem:  these readers ran 'runParser' on processed chunks of text to handle embedded block lists in lists and quotation blocks.  But then any changes made to the parser state in these chunks was lost, as the state is local to the parser. So, for example, footnotes didn't work in quotes or list items.
Fixed two small haddock bugs.
Fixed a minor mistake introduced in resolving conflicts from the merge.
Fixed bug with 'shift' in html2markdown and markdown2pdf.
Fix a bug in 'uninstall-exec' target.
Portability fixes and various cleanups in wrapper scripts: + Fix the tests at the header of wrappers.  which(1) doesn't behave as   expected on some systems.  We should only assume that it's pretty widely   available (for example, it's a builtin in csh) and we should only rely on   its exit code by ignoring its output. + Replace 'echo -n' with 'printf' as the latter is recommended. + In markdown2pdf script, '--suffix' and '--backup' options of mv(1) appear   to be GNU-ism.  Apply a workaround. + Wrap some long lines to fit in an 80-column screen. + Remove spaces at the line ends.
Fix a serious bug in Makefile.  'make' should recompile when a source file has been modified.
Fixed two small Haddock comment bugs in Shared.hs.
Fixes from last review: + Add markdown2pdf to %.pdf dependencies. + Make build-all target explicitly depend on build-program, instead of   'all' which might be changed in future. + Add build-program to osx-pkg-prep for the sake of explicitness. + Generate INSTALL.html in build-doc.
Fix all the errors lintian(1) reported: + "SEE ALSO" sections of man files have paragraph fillings errors which   groff(1) complains ("cannot adjust line").  This is because .BR line in   "SEE ALSO" section is too long to break properly.  Fix all man pages.   While on it, move all AUTHORS section to the end of the files, this   section should come last. + lintian(1) complains about the debian/changelog symlink:     W: pandoc source: changelog-is-symlink     N:     N:   The file debian/changelog is a symlink instead of a regular file. This     N:   is unnecessary and makes package checking and manipulation more     N:   difficult. If the changelog should be available in the source package     N:   under multiple names, make debian/changelog the real file and the     N:   other names symlinks to it.     N:     N:   This problem may have prevented lintian from performing other checks,     N:   leading to undetected changelog errors.   Reverse the source and targets in symlink to fix this warning.  Now, the   Debian packages can be cleanly built.
Fix a bug in variable substitution.
Fixed jgm's email address in debian changelog.
* Fix man files installation so that we really ignore .svn directories. * Remove $datadir/doc/pandoc on uninstall-doc.  Only this directory is   removed since it's a cruft directory due to its name. I couldn't find   a reliable method to remove other directories created on installation. * Use fakeroot when invoking dpkg-buildpackage.  Improve warnings in   'deb' target.
