oops peer unlocked before return - fixes deadlock
uncomment future block TD check, add test for skipping TD check on future block
fix deadlock issue in AddBlock - add peer switch channel arg to activateChain - no peer locking within - proper locking in AddBlock - fixes deadlock issue - comment out TD check and skip incorrect TD test again for hotfix
future queued block support - queued       bool // flag for blockpool to skip TD check - set to true when future block queued - in checkTD: skip check if queued - TODO: add test (insertchain sets future block)
put back checkTD and unskip incorrectTD test
introduce peers registry on nodes - TestPeerPromotionByTdOnBlock renamed and skipped for now test should pass iff   if TD is updated based on an agreement - senders register in AddBlock, flag records if they are coming from newblock   message (and therefore advertise their TD with the block) or block message   (TODO: latter are stored on the cache and updated by checkTD call;   protocol should also call AddBlock on newblock messages by non-best peers) - remove TD update from optional TD field in addBlock: this is no longer part of   the eth protocol spec -> TODO: reflect in wiki - only initialise peer map if at least two
fix blockpool deadlock - do not break from headsection on error [remove peer after protocol quit will close switchC, until then head block can arrive and block on channel while keeping peers lock causing a deadlock.] - more careful locking in AddBlock

fix blockpool test logger
independent flag for json structured logging - logjson flag remove logformat flag - passed to eth Config - logsystem not a field of Ethereum - LogSystem does not need to expose GetLogLevel/SetLogLevel - message struct just implements more generic LogMsg interface - LogMsg is a fmt.Stringer with Level() - jsonMsg ([]byte) implements LogMsg - remove "raw" systems - move level logic inside StdLogSystem - logsystems only print their kind of msg: jsonLogSystem prints jsonMsg, StdLogSystem prints stdMsg
Idle too long error incorrectly triggered even when peer sending new blocks - fix status chain map uses common.Hash as key - add badPeers increment to IncorrectTD errors (forgotten) - signal head info update to head section process even if parent hash is not in pool (inserted), so that idle timer can be set to nil - suicideC -> peer.headInfoTimer - quit -> peer.bestIdleTimer - and they are properly set from within getBlockHashes and handleSection

cmd/ethereum, cmd/mist, core, eth, javascript, xeth: fixes for new p2p API
API changed to use Pubkey only. Reflected that change in the rest of the api
cmd/peerserver: is gone
p2p: integrate p2p/discover
p2p/discover: add some helper functions
p2p/discover: new package implementing the Node Discovery Protocol
rlp: fix encoding of arrays with byte element type
crypto: make it easier to run Sha3 on multiple inputs
key generation abstracted out, for testing with deterministic keys
fix clientidentity test after privkey removed
get rid of Private Key in ClientIdentity
make crypto handshake calls package level, store privateKey on peer + tests ok
apply handshake related improvements from p2p.crypto branch
add temporary forced session token generation
peer-level integration test for crypto handshake - add const length params for handshake messages - add length check to fail early - add debug logs to help interop testing (!ABSOLUTELY SHOULD BE DELETED LATER) - wrap connection read/writes in error check - add cryptoReady channel in peer to signal when secure session setup is finished - wait for cryptoReady or timeout in TestPeersHandshake
chop first byte when cryptoid.PubKeyS is set from identity.Pubkey() since this is directly copied in the auth message
add initial peer level test (failing)
add code documentation
changes that fix it all: - set proper public key serialisation length in pubLen = 64 - reset all sizes and offsets - rename from DER to S (we are not using DER encoding) - add remoteInitRandomPubKey as return value to respondToHandshake - add ImportPublicKey with error return to read both EC golang.elliptic style 65 byte encoding and 64 byte one - add ExportPublicKey falling back to go-ethereum/crypto.FromECDSAPub() chopping off the first byte - add Import - Export tests - all tests pass
important fix for peer pubkey. when taken from identity, chop first format byte!
add equality check for nonce and remote nonce
add minor comments to the test
first stab at integrating crypto in our p2p - abstract the entire handshake logic in cryptoId.Run() taking session-relevant parameters - changes in peer to accomodate how the encryption layer would be switched on - modify arguments of handshake components - fixed test getting the wrong pubkey but it till crashes on DH in newSession()
integrate cryptoId into peer and connection lifecycle
completed the test. FAIL now. it crashes at diffie-hellman. ECIES -> secp256k1-go panics
handshake test to crypto
handshake test to crypto
fix crash - add session token check and fallback to shared secret in responder call too - use explicit length for the types of new messages - fix typo resp[resLen-1] = tokenFlag
rewrite to comply with latest spec - correct sizes for the blocks : sec signature 65, ecies sklen 16, keylength 32 - added allocation to Xor (should be optimized later) - no pubkey reader needed, just do with copy - restructuring now into INITIATE, RESPOND, COMPLETE -> newSession initialises the encryption/authentication layer - crypto identity can be part of client identity, some initialisation when server created
add crypto auth logic to p2p
fix protocol to accomodate  privkey
add privkey to clientIdentity + tests
initial hook for crypto handshake (void, off by default)
Undone fix. Will re-enable once chain resets

add blockhash vm tests
major blockpool change - the spec says response to getBlockHashes(from, max) should return all hashes starting from PARENT of from. This required major changes and results in much hackier code. - Introduced a first round block request after peer introduces with current head, so that hashes can be linked to the head - peerInfo records currentBlockHash, currentBlock, parentHash and headSection - AddBlockHashes checks header section and creates the top node from the peerInfo of the best peer - AddBlock checks peerInfo and updates the block there rather than in a node - request further hashes once a section is created but then no more until the root block is found (so that we know when to stop asking) - in processSection, when root node is checked and receives a block, we need to check if the section has a parent known to blockchain or blockPool - when peers are switched, new peer launches a new requestHeadSection loop or activates its actual head section, i.e., the section for it currentBlockHash - all tests pass
add ErrInsufficientChainInfo error
adapt unit tests to spec - AddBlockHashes ignores the first hash (just used to match getBlockHashes query) sends the rest as blocksMsg - new test TestPeerWithKnownParentBlock - new test TestChainConnectingWithParentHash - adapt all other tests to the new scheme
no need to call AddBlockHashes when receiving new block

merge upstream; fix port in use warning; new logger API
gui stop - introduce gui.Stop() - remember state with open - stopping ethereum stack is not gui concern, moved to main - stopping mining, gui and ethereum handled via interrupt callbacks - ^C triggers exactly the same behaviour as quit via menu
log slider - only add the gui logger after window is shown otherwise slider wont be shown - need to silence gui logger after window closed otherwise logsystem hangs - gui.GetLogLevelInt() extra function needed to give correcty int typecast value to gui widget that sets initial loglevel to default

Logging order
merge upstream
refactor config (transitional). Details: - ReadConfig initialiser sets up global ethutil.Config via config file passed from wrappers - does not write out adhoc default (not meant to) but creates empty config file if it does not exist so that globalconf does not complain if persists a flag - default datadir and default config file set together with other flag defaults in wrappers - default assetpath set together with other command line flags defaults in gui wrapper (not in ethutil.Config or ui/ui_lib) - add EnvPrefix, to handle environment variable options too via globalconf - this is still transitional: global Config should just be a wrapper around globalconfig config handler and should be moved to go-ethereum - actual eth stack config should not be global instead config handled properly with explicit dependency injectioninto eth stack component instances
modified logging API - package vars for tagged loggers - weed out spurious fmt.PrintX and log.PrintX logging - tried to second guess loglevel for some :)
refactor logging. Details: - packages use tagged logger sending log messages to shared (process-wide) logging engine - log writers (interface ethlog.LogSystem) can be added to the logging engine by wrappers/guis/clients - shared logging engine dispatching to multiple log systems - log level can be set separately per log system - async logging thread: logging IO does not block main thread - log messages are synchronously stringified to avoid incorrectly logging of changed states - README.md - loggers_test
Let the state create the object
fix imports in ui_lib and flags cos of defaultAssetPath move; fix logLevel type for gui
merge upstream
refactor cli and gui wrapper code. Details: - all cli functions shared between ethereum and ethereal abstracted to utils/ cmd.go (should be ethcommon or shared or sth) - simplify main() now readable stepwise - rename main wrapper files to main.go - rename commmand line args definition file from config.go to flags.go - rename Do -> Start to parallel option names - register interrupt for rpc server stop - fix interrupt stopping js repl and ethereum - register interrupt for mining stop - custom config file option from command line - debug option from command line - loglevel option from command line - changed ethutil.Config API - default datadir and default config file set together with other flag defaults in wrappers - default assetpath set together with other command line flags defaults in gui wrapper (not in ethutil.Config or ui/ui_lib) - options precedence: default < config file < environment variables < command line
