docs: bitstring attributes are strings [ci-skip]
In #4342, part of the functionalities of form_for was delegated to form_with, this could potentially cause some regress, as the condition to send polymorphic_path(record, {}) instead of polymorphic_path(record, format: options.delete(:format)) is removed and when format is not passed, this causes issues if the caller is not expecting an extra arg format:nil. This PR adds back the condition inside for with and add a test to make sure it doesn't break for_with

Start passing cipher from EncryptedCookieJar since we use it to determine key length
Follow up of #25602 Since keys are truncated, ruby 2.4 doesn't accept keys greater than their lenghts. keys of same value but different lenght and greater than key size of cipher, produce the same results as reproduced at https://gist.github.com/rhenium/b81355fe816dcfae459cc5eadfc4f6f9 Since our default cipher is 'aes-256-cbc', key length for which is 32 bytes, limit the length of key being passed to Encryptor to 32 bytes. This continues to support backwards compat with any existing signed data, already encrupted and signed with 32+ byte keys. Also fixes the passing of this value in multiple tests.

DirtyModel uses a hash to keep track of any changes made to attributes of an instance. When using the attribute_will_change! method, you must supply a string and not a symbol or the *_changed? method will break (because it is looking for the attribute name as a string in the keys of the underlying hash). To remedy this, I simply made the underlying hash a HashWithIndifferentAccess so it won't matter if you supply the attribute name as a symbol or string to attribute_will_change!.

fixed support for DATABASE_URL for rake db tasks - added tests to confirm establish_connection uses DATABASE_URL and   Rails.env correctly even when no arguments are passed in. - updated rake db tasks to support DATABASE_URL, and added tests to   confirm correct behavior for these rake tasks.  (Removed   establish_connection call from some tasks since in those cases   the :environment task already made sure the function would be called) - updated Resolver so that when it resolves the database url, it   removes hash values with empty strings from the config spec (e.g.   to support connection to postgresql when no username is specified).

Undo unwarranted change to coding conventions. I am not a fan of the aesthetics of private/public at the root but more importantly, we should not be changing coding conventions with almost a decades worth of history at a whim. The conventions are there to have a consistent coding style, that is their primary purpose. When there is so much existing code with the existing style, any change will have to lift an enormous burden of proof as to why its overwhelmingly superior. That is not the case here, so this is being reverted.

Make handlers a registered detail.
Get rid of update_details in favor of passing details to find_template.
it is now possible to pass details options (:formats, :details, :locales, ...) to #render, #find_template and friends. this doesn't change anything in global context.
Add rake test:template.
No need to recalculate the @details_key after update_details.
Not checking for nil is apparently a lot faster.
Updated existing test that fails with this fix (8d63678d1406c5518d437709af0fde717c0248d7).  Before the fix the test was giving a false positive, because file_store.key_file_path would return an empty filename (i.e. test/tmp_cache/4D0/F4D rather than test/tmp_cache/4D0/F4D/xxxx…).

AS guide: document in Module#delegate that the method must be public in the target
Don't reference ActiveRecord::Base in initializers/wrap_parameters.rb. Use config.active_record instead. This yields about a 20% decrease in startup time because it means that the connection is not created immediately on startup. Of course, this is only useful if you are not going to immediately use the database after startup.
In 1efd88283ef68d912df215125951a87526768a51, ConnectionAdapters was put under eager_autoload. Due to the requires in that file, this caused ConnectionSpecification to be loaded, which references ActiveRecord::Base, which means the database connection is established. We do not want to connect to the database when Active Record is loaded, only when ActiveRecord::Base is first referenced by the user.
document Array#append and Array#prepend methods in AS guide
Remove unused require.
Be more lazy about creating time zone objects. Decreases startup time by about 10%. (#734)
Don't refer to ActionController::Base in the wrap_parameters initializer - use config object instead. Cuts about 15% off the load time. (#734)

Need to include public_send
Split up the definitions in Module#delegate depending on :allow_nil, and don't use exceptions for flow control in the :allow_nil => true case.
Just do the method call directly in Module#delegate, if we can (we cannot for method names ending in '='). Two reasons: 1) it's faster, see https://gist.github.com/1089783 and 2) more importantly, delegate should not allow you to accidentally call private or protected methods.
Backport Object#public_send to 1.8 so that we can implement Module#delegate such that non-public methods raise

Quote these dates to prevent intermittent test failure. Suppose local time is 00:50 GMT+1. Without the quoting, the YAML parser would parse this as 00:50 UTC, into the local time of 01:50 GMT+1. Then, it would get written into the database in local time as 01:50. When it came back out the UTC date from the database and the UTC date of two weeks ago would be compared. The former would be 23:50, and the latter would be 00:50, so the two dates would differ, causing the assertion to fail. Quoting it prevents the YAML parser from getting involved.

Moved dependencies from Gemfile to gemspec to eliminate redundant declarations.

moving test_generate to an integration test with one assert per test
We actually don't need a reverse_merge! here. dup removed was giving error with nil class.

Add SelectManager#source method to get the source of the ctx
Add SelectManager#projections= method to overwrite projections

Make it the responsibility of the connection to hold onto an ARel visitor for generating SQL. This improves the code architecture generally, and solves some problems with marshalling. Adapter authors please take note: you now need to define an Adapter.visitor_for method, but it degrades gracefully with a deprecation warning for now.
Make it the responsibility of the connection to hold on to a visitor for generating SQL, rather than the TreeManager. (There is a related commit coming in Active Record.)
Ignore Gemfile.lock
Further monkey-patching to avoid deprecation warnings
Initialize config.assets.version the same way it's done in Sprockets
Support update statements containing joins
guides generation: apparently this workaround for RedCloth is not needed anymore
Added irregular zombie inflection, so zombies no longer gets singularized into zomby
edit changelog to mention about x_sendfile_header default change
x_sendfile_header now defaults to nil and production.rb env file doesn't set a particular value for it. This allows servers to set it through X-Sendfile-Type, read https://github.com/rack/rack/blob/master/lib/rack/sendfile.rb for more info. Anyways you can force this value in your production.rb
Test against 1.9.3 as well.

Remove short circuit evaluation and leave AST as it is
Add nodes for boolean constants
Quote these dates to prevent intermittent test failure. Suppose local time is 00:50 GMT+1. Without the quoting, the YAML parser would parse this as 00:50 UTC, into the local time of 01:50 GMT+1. Then, it would get written into the database in local time as 01:50. When it came back out the UTC date from the database and the UTC date of two weeks ago would be compared. The former would be 23:50, and the latter would be 00:50, so the two dates would differ, causing the assertion to fail. Quoting it prevents the YAML parser from getting involved.
make assert_difference error message not suck

Reversing the changes done in c278a2c while still resolving #1857. The changes broke bulk migration tests and were fixed in 4d256bc6; however that brought back the issue of #1857 and so this commit goes back to the original scenario and just adds change_table to the list of methods which are to be recorded in the CommandRecorder.

Oops, this should have been in the last commit :zap:
Make assert_no_queries literally enforce that there are no queries. As in, not a single line of SQL should be sent to the database, not even stuff that is ignored by assert_queries. The argument being that if you write assert_no_queries, you really do not want there to be any queries.

Replace inline lambdas with named methods
Refactor tests to be less brittle
Move BEGIN and COMMIT into IGNORED_SQL rather than having them as a special case in assert_queries

Refactor Active Record test connection setup. Please see the RUNNING_UNIT_TESTS file for details, but essentially you can now configure things in test/config.yml. You can also run tests directly via the command line, e.g. ruby path/to/test.rb (no rake needed, uses default db connection from test/config.yml). This will help us fix the CI by enabling us to isolate the different Rails versions to different databases.
Force RAILS_ENV=development in rackup_test.rb. This fixes a problem on the CI server. For some reason the RAILS_ENV on the CI server is production, which means that the ActionDispatch::Static middleware is not used, and so the request in 'config.ru can be racked up' returns a 404 rather than a 200.

added an alias for new to build to the AR collection proxy, this corrects an issue where the collection proxies were not consistent
The example in the API docs incorrectly indicated that form_for would use the same default route for both new and previously persisted records.  The default path given in the example would have generated a routing error for new records.  form_for actually uses polymorphic_path to determine which route to use based on the state of the record.  The example has been updated to reflect the method's actual behavior.

Bring back support for passing a callable object to the default_scope macro. You can also just use a block.
Un-deprecate using 'default_scope' as a macro, but if you are calling the macro multiple times that will give deprecation warnings, and in 3.2 we will simply overwrite the default scope when you call the macro multiple times.
AS Json parse_error makes a return for backwards compatibility, although it will return MultiJson::DecodeError

Add some very simple docs.
Remove rescue as it was clobbering the real error.
Return nil from read_attribute(:foo) if 'foo' is not present in the @attributes hash, but the _foo method has been defined. This brings the behaviour into line with the 3-0-stable branch and the master branch before 93641ed6c8c684f6b4db02b6c8a22fa9bc7f0eaf (there were previously no assertions about this which is why the change slipped through). Note that actually calling the 'foo' method will still raise an error if the attribute is not present.
Undo performances regressions I introduced in bbe0a507f287c20ab4ae8a244fbfc810665deda5 and add test for an edge case. Add comments to explain the intent of the code.

inserting big decimals as strings works consistently among dbs, so use string form
insert statements are prepared, but values are not escaped properly
adding a type cast method for prepared statements
ruby 1.9.2 and other ruby implementations may not return the same hash value for the same string each time. This can result in your static assets being served from different asset hosts, which makes browser caching less effective. Use md5 or some other digest method instead.
Extract the constraint-building for joins in JoinAssociation into a separate method to make it easy to change/override (requested by Ernie Miller so that MetaWhere can add to it easily)

Index sprockets environment if perform caching is enabled
Deprecate defining scopes with a callable (lambda, proc, etc) via the scope class method. Just define a class method yourself instead.
ActiveRecord::Base.scopes hash is not needed
Evaluate default scopes at the last possible moment in order to avoid problems with default scopes getting included into other scopes and then being unable to remove the default part via unscoped.
Deprecated support for passing hashes and relations to default_scope, in favour of defining a 'default_scope' class method in the model. See the CHANGELOG for more details.
Removing the scope-caching which happens on association proxies, because the query is already cached by the query cacher. For formalised proof see http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wDefXLb-FDs

Documentation for recent refinements to association deletion

This string should continue
Correctly update counter caches on deletion for has_many :through [#2824 state:resolved]. Also fixed a bunch of other counter cache bugs in the process, as once I fixed this one others started appearing like nobody's business.
Support the :dependent option on has_many :through associations. For historical and practical reasons, :delete_all is the default deletion strategy employed by association.delete(*records), despite the fact that the default strategy is :nullify for regular has_many. Also, this only works at all if the source reflection is a belongs_to. For other situations, you should directly modify the through association.
Make record.association.destroy(*records) on habtm and hm:t only delete records in the join table. This is to make the destroy method more consistent across the different types of associations. For more details see the CHANGELOG entry.

Make use of helpers in AssociationReflection
Has many through - It is not necessary to manually merge in the conditions hash for the through record, because the creation is done directly on the through association, which will already handle setting the conditions.
@join_table_name is no longer used
Make AssociationCollection#include? a bit more readable
Don't use method_missing when we don't have to
AssociationCollection#clear can basically just use #delete_all, except it should return self.
AssociationCollection#to_ary should definitely dup the target! Also changed #replace which was previously incorrect, but the test passed due to the fact that to_a was not duping.
Just use primary_key here, AR::Relation will resolve the ambiguity before it is converted to SQL
Call sum on the scope directly, rather than relying on method_missing and calculate
Condense first_or_last a bit more
Get rid of separate reset_target! and reset_scopes_cache! methods
target is always an array

Test non zero exit code and that a message still appears when generating inside an existing Rails directory.
Dir.chdir is not useful in this test, that was for another one I am planning to do.
Added test to ensure non zero exit codes when generating an application with a reserved name.
Exit with non-zero to signal failure.
Use exit(1) instead of exit(false)
Use Thor's self.exit_on_failure? to exit whenever accessing the generators from the CLI and a Thor::Error is raised.
Apply exit code 1 when commands don't succeed so that other libraries can properly detect the failure.

test_with_polymorphic_and_condition works without the conditions methods in BelongsToPolymorphicAssociation because the conditions are added straight to the association_scope as of a few days ago
Support for create_association! for has_one associations
Refactor the code for singular association constructors. This will allow me to define a create_association! method in a minute.
It's not necessary to pass the association proxy class around now
Get rid of set_association_target and association_loaded? as the parts of the code that need that can now just use association_proxy(:name).loaded?/target=
We can use the association_proxy method directly in HasOneThroughAssociation now
DRY up the code which instantiates the association proxy
find_target can be inherited
Document the recent changes to association assignment
Raise ActiveRecord::RecordNotSaved if an AssociationCollection fails to be replaced
When assigning a has_one, if anything fails, the assignment should be rolled back entirely
In a number of places in the tests, we only need to turn off transactional fixtures when the DB does not support savepoints. This speeds the test run up by about 8-9% on my computer, when running rake test_sqlite3_mem :)
SQLite3 has supported savepoints since version 3.6.8, we should use this!
When assigning a has_one, if the new record fails to save, raise an error
When assigning a has_one, if the existing record fails to be removed from the association, raise an error
Have a separate test connection directory for sqlite3 in-memory so that the tests can be run without having to specifically rename the connection file (which then causes git to pick up the changes)
Enable the sqlite3 in-memory test connection to work
has_one should always remove the old record (properly), even if not saving the new record, so we don't get the database into a pickle
Return value is irrelevant here as the RHS of the assignment is always returned by methods ending in '='
Remove incorrect documentation about build_assoc on has_one. This is proven, for example, by test_successful_build_association in has_one_associations_test.rb
For a singular association, it should be build_association, rather than association.build (as association may be nil)
Correctly indent the bullet points under 'One-to-one associations', so that the lines are not broken in the generated rdoc html

merge_with_conditions is not necessary because the conditions will already be in the scope_for_create hash in the scope
Not really worth having the HasAssociation module for just a single method
Construct an actual ActiveRecord::Relation object for the association scope, rather than a hash which is passed to apply_finder_options. This allows more flexibility in how the scope is created, for example because scope.where(a, b) and scope.where(a).where(b) mean different things.

Explicitly select * from has_and_belongs_to_many association tables, simplify exists? query
require ActiveSupport deprecatation file before using deprecate method in database_statements
Remove undocumented feature from has_one where you could pass false as the second parameter to build_assoc or create_assoc, and the existing associated object would be untouched (the foreign key would not be nullified, and it would not be deleted). If you want behaviour similar to this you can do the following things:
ActiveRecord::Relation#primary_key should return a string, just like ActiveRecord::Base.primary_key does.
Implement deprecated version of AssociationReflection#primary_key_name, which has been renamed to #foreign_key. Also bumping the deprecation_horizon in Active Support to 3.1.
When preloading a belongs_to, the target should still be set (to nil) if there is no foreign key present. And the loaded flag should be set on the association proxy. This then allows us to remove the foreign_key_present? check from BelongsToAssociation#find_target. Also added a test for the same thing on polymorphic associations.
Create the association scope directly rather than going through with_scope
Make Relation#create_with always merge rather than overwrite, not just when merging two relations. If you wish to overwrite, you can do relation.create_with(nil), or for a specific attribute, relation.create_with(:attr => nil).
Use the association directly in other places too
Let AssociationCollection#find use #scoped to do its finding. Note that I am removing test_polymorphic_has_many_going_through_join_model_with_disabled_include, since this specifies different behaviour for an association than for a regular scope. It seems reasonable to expect scopes and association proxies to behave in roughly the same way rather than having subtle differences.
Rename AssociationProxy#foreign_key_present to foreign_key_present?
Allow assignment on has_one :through where the owner is a new record [#5137 state:resolved]
Have a proper AssociationReflection#foreign_type method rather than using options[:foreign_type]
Add documentation for the :foreign_type option on belongs_to
Some basic tests for the :foreign_type option on belongs_to, which was previously completely untested.

Rename AssociationReflection#primary_key_name to foreign_key, since the options key which it relates to is :foreign_key
Support for :counter_cache on polymorphic belongs_to
Refactor BelongsToAssociation to allow BelongsToPolymorphicAssociation to inherit from it
Specify the STI type condition using SQL IN rather than a whole load of ORs. Required a fix to ActiveRecord::Relation#merge for properly merging create_with_value. This also fixes a situation where the type condition was appearing twice in the resultant SQL query.
Verify that when has_many associated objects are destroyed via :dependent => :destroy, when the parent is destroyed, the callbacks are run
Get rid of extra_conditions param from configure_dependency_for_has_many. I can't see a particularly plausible argument for this being used by plugins, and if they really want they can just redefine the callback or whatever. Note also that before my recent commit the extra_conditions param was completely ignored for :dependent => :destroy.
And owner_quoted_id can go too
Now we can drop-kick AssociationReflection#dependent_conditions into oblivion.
Refactor configure_dependency_for_has_many to use AssociationCollection#delete_all. It was necessary to change test_before_destroy in lifecycle_test.rb so that it checks topic.replies.size *before* doing the destroy, as afterwards it will now (correctly) be 0.
Recreate symlink in layouts for tests
Do not take gems' i18n locales while testing locales paths
Don't be so picky on MissingTemplate error details, this fails randomly on 1.8.7 because of not ordered hash

Add a HasAssociation module for common code for has_* associations
Remove AssociationProxy#dependent? - it's badly named and only used in one place
Associations: DRY up the code which is generating conditions, and make it all use arel rather than SQL strings
Remove custom_select param from construct_select, as it isn't used
Remove construct_from from ThroughAssociationScope - it's not called from anywhere
Set the create scope to an empty hash in ThroughAssociationScope. For reasoning please see the inline code comments.
Use conditionals and implicit returns rather than explicit returns and postfix ifs (it's easier to read)
Remove has_cached_counter? and cached_counter_attribute_name from HasManyThroughAssociation, as the exact same methods are inherited from HasManyAssociation
Remove pointless use of 'private'
Use the through association proxy for operations on the through record, so that those operations are automatically scoped and therefore construct_join_attributes does not need to use construct_owner_attributes.
Remove target_obsolete? which is not called from anywhere
scoped.where_values_hash is never nil

Verify that there is no unwanted implicit readonly set on Model.has_many_through.find(id) [#5442 state:resolved]
Raise an error for associations which try to go :through a polymorphic association [#6212 state:resolved]
If a has_many goes :through a belongs_to, and the foreign key of the belongs_to changes, then the has_many should be considered stale.
Improved strategy for updating a belongs_to association when the foreign key changes. Rather than resetting each affected association when the foreign key changes, we should lazily check for 'staleness' (where fk does not match target id) when the association is accessed.
Test to verify that #2189 (count with has_many :through and a named_scope) is fixed
Revert "Optimize <association>_ids for hm:t with belongs_to source". The optimisation has too many edge cases, such as when the reflection, source reflection, or through reflection has conditions, orders, etc. [#6153 state:resolved]
Test demonstrating problem with foo.association_ids where it's a has_many :through with :conditions, with a belongs_to as the source reflection
When a has_many association is not :uniq, appending the same record multiple times should append it to the @target multiple times [#5964 state:resolved]

Clean IdentityMap before running each benchmark.
No need to specify clear is a method from IM when we are inside IM.
IM enable should be kept in current thread.
"there is no need to store this option just for initialization" José Valim dixit.
identity_map name is used for configuration, use IdentityMap to access it.
Simplify remove_from_config.
Enable IdentityMap when generating new apps.
We have to check object class to avoid issues when using STI.
Enable IM in performance script unless IM=disabled is set when running it.
IM is disabled by default.
Add test using identity map and select.
No need to check returned object now that weakhash is gone.
Usa Hash instead of WeakHash.
Revert "Use ActiveSupport::WeakHash for MRI, JRuby prefers Weakling."
Read from config, because AR may not be loaded yet.
Set IdentityMap disabled by default.
We don't need to dup key, since only value is weak.
Refactor associations cache removal from IM. (ht: Aaron Patterson)
Update number of queries executed instead of avoiding IM.
Don't change tests, fix code: if locking is enabled skip IM.

Test setup method should clean up IM.
Query objects if readonly_value is false, skip them only if nil.
Added method to IM to remove objects by class and id. Then used it to remove objects when updating counters.
Clear IdentityMap before continue this test, we can do this here because store_full_sti_class is not supposed to change during "runtime".
Call super setup in this test.
Ups, forgot to remove one conflict tag from previous commit.
Revert "IdentityMap - Adjustments to test cases"
Don't load IdentityMap middleware if not enabled. Simplify middleware.
Don't wrap into identity map if it is disabled.
Bring back "Reject attributes even if association is loaded" after rebasing to master.
Use block syntax in IdentityMap middleware.
Change API name, we don't need any param.
Use just one repository and keep it in the current thread.
Flush IdentityMap when running tests.
Use association_class method which returns the reflection class, this method is redefined in polymorphic belongs to associations.
Use IdentityMap middleware to flush map on each request.
Add initial tests for WeakHash.
Check if constant is defined in AR, if not this can cause errors when using polymorphic associations.
Use conditional to avoid warnings.
Weakling is only required for JRuby.
Use ActiveSupport::WeakHash for MRI, JRuby prefers Weakling.
Use hash[:Post][1] style identity maps for each table.
IdentityMap is enabled by default.
Add docs to Identity Map.
Added config syntax to enable/disable identity map: config.active_record.identity_map = true
Reeject attributes even if association is loaded
Test reorganization
Separated initialization
Set Identity Map disabled by default. Enable it for testing.
Test with target object, failing on 1.9.2 when comparing object against association proxy object.
Testing objects equality is what we are looking for here, no query caching.
Change test models.
Use strings primary keys in identity map keys to avoid problems with casting and also allow strings primary keys.
implicit_readonly is not set until records are loaded, just check readonly_value and then set readonly status.
Don't use identity map if loading readonly records, this will prevent changing readonly status on already loaded records.
Add tests for inverse relations when using has many and identity map.
Remove associated object from identity map when reloading.
Associated objects are assigned from identity map if enabled and contains associated object.
Add test for update_attributes and identity map.
Remove objects from identity map if save! failed, otherwise finding again the same record will have invalid attributes.
Remove objects from identity map if save failed, otherwise finding again the same record will have invalid attributes.
Add test to show that when IdentityMap is disabled finders returns different objects.
Uncomment test and make it work.
Use yield instead block argument.
Disable identity map when loading associated records from habtm.
Prevent pushing duplicated records when using identity map.
Remove associated records from identity map if any raised an unexpected exception.

corrected the AV railtie to use the new home for cache_asset_timestamps, and merged asset id caching and asset paths together.
reorganised the the common asset helpers module into a class and have it include the id caching module, this class is now shared from the view instance to the asset include tag helpers (js and css)
incorporated most of the feedback from José
reduced duplication between the javascript and stylesheet asset tag methods, also split the asset id caching methods into a separate module for easy inclusion and use by the asset include tag class and base asset tag helpers
removed an assert from a test as it was testing a private method
separated the asset id methods to a separate module, removed some dupliation with the various path methods, and moved the base asset tag methods to a base module so the asset id module can play nice with the path generation
split the javascript and stylesheet tag helpers into separate files as a precusor before removing the duplication between the two

This test is invalid for new router
Removed deprecated_mapper - we don't need it anymore
Removed tests for setting default value of *path in route

Small tidy up on Rails::Engine.
This commit merges most of the work done by Piotr Sarnacki in his Ruby Summer of Code project.
Do not use ActionController::Base.page_cache_extension in initialize to not load more ActiveSupport than we need
Optimize ActionDispatch::Static
Forgot to move that line to railtie on rebase
I've changed that test along the way, it should actually stay without changes
Use default_scope in isolated Engines to not force user to scope his routes
Implemented RouteSet#default_scope, which allows to set the scope for the entire routes object
engines_blank_point should always be the last initializer in Engine
We should avoid creating additional initializers when we can, adding them makes boot process slower
Add some documantation on new route_key and param_key in ActiveModel::Naming
Remove namespace for isolated namespaced models in forms
Use new ActiveModel::Naming.route_key in polymorphic_routes

Move RoutesProxy to separate file
Include all helpers from non-namespaced engines
Set only helpers_path on inherited hook in action_controller/railtie.rb and use helper(:all) just after that
Added more tests for polymorphic_url with namespaced models and implemented missing use cases
This was used only to clear warning in ActionMailer tests, it shouldn't be done like that
Moved ActionMailer and ActionController railties options to inherited hook

Move ActionController::Railties::RoutesHelpers and ActionMailer::Railties::RoutesHelper to AbstractController::Railties::RoutesHelpers
Include routes helpers only for inherited classes in ActionMailer
Include application's helpers and router helpers by default, but include engine's ones for controllers inside isolated namespace
For view_context we need to initialize RoutesProxy in context of controller, not view, quick fix, I need to dig into it later
mounted helpers should be included in ActionMailer
This is not needed
Engine's assets are now served with ActionDispatch::Static
Modified ActionDispatch::Static to allow passing multiple roots

Added some more tests for url generation between Engine and Application
Get rid of :skip_prefix options in routes
Refactored tests for prefix generation and added test for url generation in regular class with default_url_options[:script_name] set
New way of generating urls for Application from Engine.
Allow to generate Application routes inside Engine
Pass routes via env['action_dispatch.routes'], it's needed by routes to determine if it should generate prefix for mounted apps
Use env['action_dispatch.routes'] to determine if we should generate prefix or not.
Move singleton pattern to Railtie and remove Engine::Configurable and Application::Configurable in favor of unified Railtie::Configurable
Removed most of deprecated stuff from Application and Engine
Allow Engines loading its own environment file from config/environments
Ensure that plugins are not loaded twice
We don't need to add railties initlaizers in Application as there is already done in Engine and it's called with super

We don't need to overwrite default paths in tests
Ensure that init.rb is evaled in context of Engine

Sanitize association conditions using the correct class
Refactored url_for in AV to have its own instances of the helpers instead of proxying back to the controller. This potentially allows for more standalone usage of AV.

periods are not metacharacters within character classes
Remove if/else branch when generating the documentation since we are simply inspecting the load path.

Now that class_attribute creates an instance method, remove it to avoid deprecation warnings ;)
Simplify the action endpoint:
Add memoizing to AD::Request
class_attribute gets instance methods which delegate to but may override their class values as you'd expect. Disable instance writer methods with :instance_writer => false.
Require 'active_support/core_ext/hash/except' in the router.
Clean LookupContext API.
Move request forgery protection configuration to the AC config object
Whoops. We meant to switch from returning to tap, not vice versa
Add support for mount RackApp, :at => "/sprockets" with a shorthand of mount Sprockets => "/sprockets".
Bring AM up to date with new rendering stack.
Move middlewares to the Application level. If you want to modify the middleware, either use Rails.application.config.middleware or modify it in an initializer (if you need to set it relative to user-specified middleware).

Added template lookup responsible to hold all information used in template lookup.
Bump rack-mount requirement to 0.6
Make many parts of Rails lazy. In order to facilitate this, add lazy_load_hooks.rb, which allows us to declare code that should be run at some later time. For instance, this allows us to defer requiring ActiveRecord::Base at boot time purely to apply configuration. Instead, we register a hook that should apply configuration once ActiveRecord::Base is loaded.
First take on ViewPaths clean up.

Actually, revert previous commit. Having a lot of information is better than having no information at all.
Define to_s method in ActionView::Resolver, so I'm not required to write it in inherited classes.
Remove the ability to set the mountpoint when initializing a route set.

Rack::Request actually defines #query_string
Tweak the semantic of various URL related methods of ActionDispatch::Request
Update contribute guide so that it shows the new command to generate guides (rake generate_guides instead of rake guides)
Updated 3_0_release_notes so that it specifies that the rack-mount gem needs to be version 0.4
the guides generator needs fileutils
don't depend on the order of cookies (Hash ordering bug)
Work on deprecating ActionController::Base.relative_url_root

plugin rails/init.rb deprecation message
Upon further reflection, we realized that SharedTestRoutes is not really a hack, but is instead a standin (in the Rails tests) for Rails.application.routes.
Relatively speaking, it's not actually that bad...
Setting UrlFor in with_routing is no longer needed now that it's not global
Including UrlFor in Redirecting and Head will warn usefully if a controller is wired up without a router included (and still support redirect_to "omg")

Adding Release Notes 3.0
Deprecate AC configuration values which were moved to Rack.
Convert to class_attribute
Introduce class_attribute to declare inheritable class attributes. Writing an attribute on a subclass behaves just like overriding the superclass reader method. Unifies and replaces most usage of cattr_accessor, class_inheritable_attribute, superclass_delegating_attribute, and extlib_inheritable_attribute.
Add config.generators.fallbacks.
Updates to output and warning on being for Rails 3.0
Add support for compile-time <%= raw %>

For performance reasons, you can no longer call html_safe! on Strings. Instead, all Strings are always not html_safe?. Instead, you can get a SafeBuffer from a String by calling #html_safe, which will SafeBuffer.new(self).
Have rails depend on bundler
Update the CI geminstaller to pull in the correct version of bundler

:href should be comming in through html_options and not options
removing container inline js function of observed elements :function callback
moving html_safe call into helpers directly as they only work from that level
start of prototype driver, missing observe_form, observe_field, and periodically_call_remote

Model.scoped now returns a relation if invoked without any arguments
The controller key shouldnt be part of the mapping if its not used
Move i18n to Gemfile.
This code was needed to work around http://redmine.ruby-lang.org/issues/show/2494. Since that bug is now closed in Ruby, we can remove it.
Simplify and improve the performance of output_safety
Instead of marking raw text in templates as safe, and then putting them through String#<< which checks if the String is safe, use safe_concat, which uses the original (internal) String#<< and leaves the safe flag as is. Results in a significant performance improvement.
Dead code
Translated strings in the view are assumed html_safe (Closes #3401)

Require active_support/all unless specifically requested to be left out.
Remove the ActionView::Base autoload because it creates crazy circular autoload insanity
Isolation tests intentionally avoid loading any state (because they're often testing things that have their own load path semantics that should not be polluted), so rack/test is not yet  on the load path. Moving require "rack/test" into the setup means and after boot_rails means that it'll be required after the laod path has been altered to add in the Rails vendor/gems
Routing: fix that route shorthand shouldn't ignore other options. Raise if :as option is given to root method since its name is always 'root'
Finish moving config.frameworks-dependent code to the framework plugin
Shift more responsibility from application class to its singleton instance. Treat instantiation and boot as separate steps. Use app.config rather than app.configuration.
Make /rails/info/properties work again. Also, the mocked up tests were passing so we added a test that actually tested this functionality.

Temporary fix to get our LoadError monkey-patch working with newer JRuby. We should probably remove MissingSourceFile and just monkey-patch LoadError instead of overriding LoadError.new.
Experimental: Improve performance of ActionView by preventing method cache flushing due to runtime Kernel#extend:
Cache controller_path on the AV instance to avoid needing to make additional calls back into the controller for each attempt (this was done because these calls were adding up significantly in partial rendering and showing up on profiles)
Use response_body rather than performed?
Rendering a template from ActionView will default to looking for partials only in the current mime type.

Updated vendored thor to 0.11.5
Get all ActionController partial rendering to use ActionView's partial code. Consequences:   * It is not possible to always pre-determine the layout before going to ActionView.     This was *already* broken for render :partial => @object, :layout => true. This is     now handled by overriding render_to_body in layouts.rb and manually injecting the     partial's response. This needs to be done in ActionController since ActionController     knows enough to get _layout_for_option. There is probably a better abstraction here.   * As a result, all partial rendering can correctly restrict their layouts to the mime     type of the rendered partial. This could have previously caused a bug in some edge cases.   * If other layout-like options are added, they might need to add special code for the     case of render :partial. We should try to think of an alternate solution, if possible,     but this works for the cases we know of now.
Whitespace
Continue reworking the partial path.   * TODO: Review ActionController calling render_template for certain partials.     Might we be able to save logic by always delegating to AV's render_partial?
Modify various partial methods to carry along the block that can be passed in with render   * _render_single_template, which renders a template without layout   * _render_partial_unknown_type, which renders a partial of unknown type     (the entry method for most partial rendering; supports strings, objects, and collections)   * _render_partial_object, which renders a partial for a single object.   * extracted _render_partial_path so it can be used to render the spacer without going     through the public render :partial
Replace _render_template_with_layout with _render_template since the layout is optional
Some more AV refactoring:   * remove no longer used _array_like_objects   * _render_content_with_layout renamed to _render_content since layout it optional   * remove check for optional layout before _render_content

This is handled by the resolver now

config.time_zone and TimeWithZone#marshal_load accept tzinfo/Olson identifiers
Time.zone= accepts TZInfo::Timezone instances and Olson identifiers; wraps result in TimeZone instance

nested orderings
allowing string passthrough for order clauses
added support for `attribute IN ...` and `attribute BETWEEN ...`   - IN and BETWEEN are chosen depending on the type of the second operand   - ranges (1..2), arrays ([1,2,3]), and relations ("SELECT * ...") are all supported

more inadequate tests
pending tests. better coverage though i dislike the strategy
renamed strategy method to format   - strategy (the method on scalar and attribute) is a complex double-dispatching     scheme to format (to_sql) a scalar in the light of the particular attribute;     that is, it casts strings to integers if the column is int, etc.
refactored session's interaction with engine/connection   - follows law of demeter   - Table.engine uses AR::Base adapter

Time#- coerces TimeWithZone argument to a Time instance so that difference in seconds can be calculated. Closes #10914 [Geoff Buesing, yyyc514]
Adding UTC zone to TimeZone; TimeWithZone no longer has to fake UTC zone with nil
Time.get_zone refactored to private method, given that the encapsulated logic is only useful internally
Time.zone uses thread-local variable for thread safety. Adding Time.use_zone, for overriding Time.zone locally inside a block. Removing unneeded Time.zone_reset!
Handle corner case with image_tag when passed 'messed up' image names. Closes #9018 [duncanbeevers, mpalmer]
TimeZone#to_s uses UTC rather than GMT; reapplying change that was undone in [8679]. References #1689
Time.days_in_month defaults to current year if no year is supplied as argument, uses Date.gregorian_leap? to determine leap year, and uses constant lookup to determine days in month. Closes #10799 [Radar]
Adding Time and DateTime #compare_with_coercion, which layers behavior on #<=> so that any combination of Time, DateTime and ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone instances can be chronologically compared
TimeZone#now returns an ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone
Time #in_current_time_zone and #change_time_zone_to_current return self when Time.zone is nil

Preserve integration session's request_count
Enumerable#group_by uses ActiveSupport::OrderedHash
Refactor Time and DateTime #to_formatted_s: use ternary instead of nested if/else
Adding Time and DateTime #formatted_offset, for outputting +HH:MM utc offset strings with cross-platform consistency
Adding alternate_utc_string option to TimeZone#formatted_offset. Removing unneeded TimeZone#offset
Introduce ActiveSupport::TimeWithZone, for wrapping Time instances with a TimeZone. Introduce instance methods to Time for creating TimeWithZone instances, and class methods for managing a global time zone

joining on aggregations; this time where the aggregation is on the right.
merging "schmoin" experiment with joining aggregations into regular "join" functionality; half-way done...
completed initial functionality for joining with aggregation (the meaning of which is joining on a subselect/derived table); the big change is the introduction of a #projections protected method; this is a private version of #attributes which preserves implementation information (e.g., the name of the function called)

Changed the default database from mysql to sqlite3, so now running "rails myapp" will have a config/database.yml thats setup for SQLite3 (which in OS X Leopard is installed by default, so is the gem, so everything Just Works with no database configuration at all).

Turned on ActionView::Base.cache_template_loading by default in config/environments/production.rb to prevent file system stat calls for every template loading to see if it changed (this means that you have to restart the application to see template changes in production mode) [DHH]

Change the implementation of ActiveRecord's attribute reader and writer methods:  * Generate Reader and Writer methods which cache attribute values in hashes.  This is to avoid repeatedly parsing the same date or integer columns.  * Move the attribute related methods out to attribute_methods.rb to de-clutter base.rb  * Change exception raised when users use find with :select then try to access a skipped column.  Plugins could override missing_attribute() to lazily load the columns.  * Move method definition to the class, instead of the instance  * Always generate the readers, writers and predicate methods.

apply [6543] to edge. Closes #5044 [tpope]
Added yielding of builder in Hash#to_xml [DHH]
Introduce RELATIVE_RAILS_ROOT and changed spawner script to use it. Prior to this change spawner would assume the non symlinked deploy directory which made reaper reload the wrong code after further deployments.
Tweak template format rules so that the ACCEPT header is only used if it's text/javascript.  This is so ajax actions without a :format param get recognized as Mime::JS. [Rick]
Added yielding of Builder instance for ActiveRecord::Base#to_xml calls [DHH]
remove useless mock test
The default respond_to blocks don't set a specific extension anymore, so that both 'show.rjs' and 'show.js.rjs' will work. [Rick]

add ActionView::Base#find_template_extension_for tests
Highlight helper highlights one or many terms in a single pass.
Canonicalize configuration.root_path and replace RAILS_ROOT.
Dropped the use of ; as a separator of non-crud actions on resources and went back to the vanilla slash. It was a neat idea, but lots of the non-crud actions turned out not to be RPC (as the ; was primarily intended to discourage), but legitimate sub-resources, like /parties/recent, which didn't deserve the uglification of /parties;recent. Further more, the semicolon caused issues with caching and HTTP authentication in Safari. Just Not Worth It [DHH]
Improved the handling of broken accept headers
Added that FormTagHelper#submit_tag will return to its original state if the submit fails and you're using :disable_with [DHH]
documentation project patches, closes #7342, #7319, #7316, #7190 [jeremymcanally]

Allow configuration of the default action cache path for #caches_action calls.  [Rick Olson]
SQLite: binary escaping works with ='u'. Closes #7862.
Never return nil from CGI#read_query for compatibility with plain CGI query params parser. Closes #7581.
Deprecation: remove components from controller paths.  Canonicalize RAILS_ROOT by using File.expand_path on Windows, which doesn't have to worry about symlinks, and Pathname#realpath elsewhere, which respects symlinks in relative paths but is incompatible with Windows. Closes #6755.
Hash#to_xml supports YAML attributes; ActiveRecord::Base#to_xml support serialized attributes. Closes #7502.
Refactor ActiveSupport::JSON to be less obtuse.  Add support for JSON decoding by way of Syck with ActiveSupport::JSON.decode(json_string).  Prevent hash keys that are JavaScript reserved words from being unquoted during encoding.
alias_method_chain preserves the original method's visibility. Closes #7854.
Base.update_all :order and :limit options. Useful for MySQL updates that must be ordered to avoid violating unique constraints.
Remove deprecated object transactions.  People relying on this functionality should install the object_transactions plugin at http://code.bitsweat.net/svn/object_transactions.  Closes #5637 [Koz, Jeremy Kemper]
Remove special cases for BigDecimal and SQLite, tests pass without them and fail with them.
Revert [6430] since the test is faulty. References #7837, closes #7842.
PostgreSQL: remove DateTime -> Time downcast. Bypass the DateTime migration test on 64-bit platforms since it may be a Time.
Performance: patch cgi/session/pstore to require digest/md5 once rather than per #initialize. Closes #7583.
Undeprecate redirect_to with Hash argument and additional url_for parameters. Closes #7837.
Add environment variable RAILS_DEFAULT_DATABASE, which allows the builtin default of 'mysql' to be overridden.
Update Dependencies to ignore constants inherited from ancestors. Closes #6951.
Cookie session store: ensure that new sessions doesn't reuse data from a deleted session in the same request.
Deprecation: verification with :redirect_to => :named_route shouldn't be deprecated. Closes #7525.
find_or_create_by_* takes a hash so you can create with more attributes than are in the method name. Closes #7368.
Cookie session store: raise ArgumentError when :session_key is blank.
Make sure with_scope takes both :select and :joins into account when setting :readonly.  Allows you to save records you retrieve using finders on a has_many :through associations.  [Koz]
Deprecation: remove deprecated url_for(:symbol, *args) and redirect_to(:symbol, *args) controller methods. Use named routes instead.
trim the fat
Deprecation: remove deprecated update_element_function, start_form_tag, and end_form_tag. Use RJS and form_tag instead.
Allow a polymorphic :source for has_many :through associations.  Closes #7143 [protocool]
Deprecation: remove deprecated human_size helper alias. Use number_to_human_size instead.
forgot to add tests for #7044
Deprecation: remove deprecated link_to_image and link_image_to methods. Use link_to(image_path(...), url).
Deprecation: privatize deprecated render_partial and render_partial_collection methods.
Deprecation: remove toplevel components directory and uses_component_template_root.
Deprecation: remove deprecated dependency methods.
Deprecation: remove deprecated request methods.
Deprecation: remove deprecated redirect methods.

Consistently quote primary key column names. Closes #7763.
DateTimes assume the default timezone. Closes #7764.
Backed out of using File.atomic_write in the asset_tag_helper.rb as its still half-baked. Most importantly, it creates files with different permissions than File.open/write
Caching shouldnt include the host still
Cached versions of concatted js/css asset tags have to be written out atomically.
Prefer MIME constants to strings. Closes #7707.
Sybase: hide timestamp columns since they're inherently read-only. Closes #7716.
Oracle: overflow Time to DateTime. Closes #7718.
Note that find results may not be in the same order as the id arguments. Closes #7719.
PostgreSQL: don't use async_exec and async_query with postgres-pr. Closes #7727.
Windows: include MinGW in RUBY_PLATFORM check. Closes #2982.
Allow array and hash query parameters. Array route parameters are converted/to/a/path as before. References #6765, #7462. Closes #7047.
Add a #dbman attr_reader for CGI::Session and make CGI::Session::CookieStore#generate_digest public so it's easy to generate digests using the cookie store's secret. [Rick]

Cookie store: use OpenSSL::HMAC instead of basic hash. Introduce :secret block and :digest option.
Cookie store: test that >4K raises CookieOverflow and that unverifiable cookies are automatically deleted.
Move plugin classes into the rails directory to match their namespace
Move responsibility for ensuring that all registered gems were loaded from the FileSystemLocator into the Initializer once all locators have had a chance to load the gems they located. [Marcel Molina Jr.]
Use to_sentence rather than inspect when reporting which registered plugins are missing
Split out the basic plugin locator functionality into an abstract super class. Add a FileSystemLocator to do the job of checking the plugin_paths for plugins. Add plugin_locators configuration option which will iterate over the set of plugin locators and load each of the plugin loaders they return. Rename locater everywhere to locator. [Marcel Molina Jr.]
Split plugin location and loading out of the initializer and into a new Plugin namespace, which includes Plugin::Locater and Plugin::Loader. The loader class that is used can be customized using the config.plugin_loader option.  Those monkey patching the plugin loading subsystem take note, the internals changing here will likely break your modifications. The good news is that it should be substantially easier to hook into the plugin locating and loading process now.  [Marcel Molina Jr.]
Dispatcher test requires abstract_unit. Cleanup abstract_unit.
Options are more often than not meaningless babble, just go nondescript instead
Set the original button value in an attribute of the button when using the :disable_with key with submit_tag
Add missing files
Give DateTime correct .to_s implementations, lets it play nice with ActiveRecord quoting. [gbuesing] Closes #7649
Add File.atomic_write to prevent users from seeing half written files.  Useful for situations like Page Caching and the like. [Koz]
session_enabled? works with session :off. Closes #6680.
boot.rb sets RAILS_ROOT, so remove that.  Install http plugins inside a Dir.chdir block so that the cwd doesn't change
set the RAILS_ROOT for script/plugin if it's not set already
Added assumption that all plugin creators desire to be sharing individuals and release their work under the MIT license [DHH]
mysql.rb ignores IOError in finalizer when socket is already closed
Added :port and :host handling to UrlRewriter (which unified url_for usage, regardless of whether it's called in view or controller) #7616 [alancfrancis]
Doc fixes
Allow send_file/send_data to use a registered mime type as the :type parameter #7620 [jonathan]
Allow routing requirements on map.resource(s) (closes #7633) [quixoten]
Moved perform_caching test set up into test's setup to fix a dependence fragility (closes #7640)
Added source-annotations extractor tasks to rake [Jamis Buck]
Setting fixtures automatically for integration tests is a bit harder -- will have to wait until the test superclass reform is implemented
Added fixtures :all to test_helper.rb to assume that most people just want all their fixtures loaded all the time [DHH] Added fixtures :all as a way of loading all fixtures in the fixture directory at once (closes #7214) [manfred]
Cookie session store: empty and unchanged sessions don't write a cookie.
 Allow users to provide custom formatters to Logger. [aeden] Closes #7106, #2484
fix app generator
Make it a default assumption that you want all helpers, all the time (yeah, yeah)
Added helper(:all) as a way to include all helpers from app/helpers/**/*.rb in ApplicationController [DHH]
No s on config
Include two default initializers as examples
Added config/initializers where all ruby files within it are automatically loaded after the Rails configuration is done, so you don't have to litter the environment.rb file with a ton of mixed stuff [DHH]
Move session settings closer together
Make sure parsed emails recognize attachments nested in multpart parts (closes #6714)
Ruby 1.8.6 compatibility.
Integration tests: introduce methods for other HTTP methods. Closes #6353.
Use the query cache iff Active Record is configured.
CGI escape the session cookie.
Oops, don't omit the session_key since it's used as the cookie name.
Session configuration in config/environment.rb instead of app/controllers/application.rb
Missed commit for [6184]. Generate a random secret for new app's cookie session store.
Added database connection as a yield parameter to ActiveRecord::Base.transaction so you can manually rollback [DHH]
Enable active record cache automatically for all actions
Added subdirectory test
Make sure that the filesystem is not involved with asset hosting
Routing: better support for escaped values in route segments. Closes #7544.
Introduce a cookie-based session store as the Rails default. Sessions typically contain at most a user_id and flash message; both fit within the 4K cookie size limit. A secure hash is included with the cookie to ensure data integrity (a user cannot alter his user_id without knowing the secret key included in the hash). If you have more than 4K of session data or don't want your data to be visible to the user, pick another session store. Cookie-based sessions are dramatically faster than the alternatives.
Make assert_select access content_type through accessor instead of header
Apply the rest of Chads patch
You can now use cache in instance hierachies. This allows ActiveRecord::Base.cache { } usage to cache everything
Added .erb and .builder as preferred aliases to the now deprecated .rhtml and .rxml extensions [Chad Fowler]. This is done to separate the renderer from the mime type. .erb templates are often used to render emails, atom, csv, whatever. So labeling them .rhtml doesn't make too much sense. The same goes for .rxml, which can be used to build everything from HTML to Atom to whatever. .rhtml and .rxml will continue to work until Rails 3.0, though. So this is a slow phasing out. All generators and examples will start using the new aliases, though.
Stop swallowing errors during rake test [Koz]
Factor out unique id generator. Expose cgi to session store.
Its ETag not Etag
Set cache-control to private if theres an etag available (and the cache-control hasnt been overwritten already)
Dont ask for no caching if we have a etag to base that decision on
Move etagging down to response, so renders with layouts dont screw it up [DHH]
Added caching option to AssetTagHelper#stylesheet_link_tag and AssetTagHelper#javascript_include_tag [DHH]
Allow people to set their own etags, if they want more control over the process (closes #7580) []
Add request protocol to asset host if not given. Prefer setting asset host as hostname only, no request protocol.
Work around the two connection per host browser limit: use asset%d.myapp.com to distribute asset requests among asset[0123].myapp.com. Use a DNS wildcard or CNAMEs to map these hosts to your asset server. See http://www.die.net/musings/page_load_time/ for background.
Etagging ignores appended and block responses.
Added default mime type for CSS (Mime::CSS) [DHH]
Added that rendering will automatically insert the etag header on 200 OK responses. The etag is calculated using MD5 of the response body. If a request comes in that has a matching etag, the response will be changed to a 304 Not Modified and the response body will be set to an empty string. [DHH]
Added X-Runtime to all responses with the request run time [DHH] (rename from X-Benchmark)
Added X-Benchmark to all responses with the same benchmark data as goes into the log [DHH]

Rename server_settings to smtp_settings,  add sendmail_settings to allow you to override the arguments to and location of the sendmail executable. [Koz]
When dealing with SQLite3, use the table_info pragma helper, so that the bindings can do some translation for when sqlite3 breaks incompatibly between point releases. Also, make current_adapter? use is_a? instead of instance_of? to account correctly for adapter subclassing.

Checkin failing test case related to load once paths
Base#==, eql?, and hash methods. == returns true if its argument is identical to self or if it's an instance of the same class, is not new?, and has the same id. eql? is an alias for ==. hash delegates to id.

Remove unrelated render :yaml changes. References #4185.
Update changelog to reflect application/json content type.
More thorough JSON tests. Use application/json by default, per rfc4627. References #4185.

Changelog for bungled commit.
Missed commit from [5686].
Don't do introspection queries during locking tests [Michael Schoen]
Bob's raining patches: fixes date_helper bugs and usability issues. References #3811.
Consolidated different create and create! versions to call through to the base class with scope. This fixes inconsistencies, especially related to protected attribtues.
find supports :lock with :include. Check whether your database allows SELECT ... FOR UPDATE with outer joins before using. Closes #6764.
AssociationCollection#any? takes a block [Michael Schoen]
*_path instance methods. Check for missing/invalid site uri. http_mock response takes message arg, extracts numeric code. Tests log to test/debug.log
Add AssociationCollection#create! to be consistent with AssociationCollection#create when dealing with a foreign key that is a protected attribute
Added counter optimization for AssociationCollection#any? so person.friends.any? won't actually load the full association if we have the count in a cheaper form [DHH]
Dropped the idea of automatically routing :format for the vanilla routes -- that will be a treat for map.resources. Deprecated the name route root as it'll be used as a shortcut for map.connect '' in Rails 2.0 (Rails 1.2). Added map.root as an alias for map.connect '' (Rails 2.0)
Added support for decimal types. Closes #6676.
Documentation for generators (closes #6671) [topfunky]
Added Request#format to return the format used for the request as a mime type. If no format is specified, the first Request#accepts type is used. This means you can stop using respond_to for anything else than responses [DHH]
Added the option for extension aliases to mime type registration [DHH] Refactored default mime types to use the extension framework instead of just declaring themselves verbosely
Wups
Subclasses of an abstract class work with single-table inheritance. Closes #5704.
If only life was that simple (it didnt help)
Replace the elaborate reloading connection checking scheme, just fix the Ruby-based MySQL adapter, ye?
Added one-letter aliases for the three default environments to script/console, so script/console p will load the production environment (t for test, d for development) [DHH]
Refactored to use same option setup
Premature commit
@response.redirect_url works with 201 Created responses: just return headers['Location'] rather than checking the response status.
merge 5639 to trunk
Only reload connections in development mode that supports (and requires that) -- in other words, only do it for SQLite (closes #6687, #6700) [DHH]
Use Location rather than location header.
redirect_to is the one place where _url should be used, not _path [DHH]
uses_component_template_root looks at caller[0] which turns up the deprecation method rather than the controller. Use caller[1] instead.
strip_tags passes through blank args such as nil or "".  Closes #6702, references #2229.
Added Time#to_s(:time) which will just return H:M, like 17:44 [DHH]
Tried delaying database disconnect until after dependency resolution (references #6687, #6700) [DHH]
Dont set default charset if the response is sending a file. Closes #6689 [DHH]
Update initializer to load Rails::VERSION as soon as possible. Closes #6698.
Added CSV to Mime::SET so that respond_to csv will work
* Added GET-masquarading for HEAD, so request.method will return :get even for HEADs. This will help anyone relying on case request.method to automatically work with HEAD and map.resources will also allow HEADs to all GET actions. Rails automatically throws away the response content in a reply to HEAD, so you dont even need to worry about that. If you, for whatever reason, still need to distinguish between GET and HEAD in some edge case, you can use Request#head? and even Request.headers["REQUEST_METHOD"] for get the "real" answer. Closes #6694 [DHH]
Added text/csv as a default mime type and included example on how to make your own in config/environment.rb [DHH]
Added ActiveRecord::Base.clear_active_connections! in development mode so the database connection is not carried over from request to request. Some databases won't reread the schema if that doesn't happen (I'm looking at you SQLite), so you have to restart the server after each migration (= no fun) [DHH]
Actually require the gem found
Made RAILS_GEM_VERSION work for beta gems too, so specifying 1.1.6 will give you 1.1.6.4520 if available [DHH]
Dont include the mime.yml anyway, Mongrel will just ship with more defaults instead

Ensure render_to_string cleans up after itself when an exception is raised. Closes #6658. Great tests!
validates_numericality_of uses \A \Z to ensure the entire string matches rather than ^ $ which may match one valid line of a multiline string. Closes #5716.
Run validations in the order they were declared. Closes #6657.
Extract template_changed_since? from compile_template? so plugins may override its behavior for non-file-based templates. Closes #6651.
MySQL: detect when a NOT NULL column without a default value is misreported as default ''.  Can't detect for string, text, and binary columns since '' is a legitimate default. Closes #6156.

Support nil and Array in :conditions => { attr => value } hashes. Closes #6548.
Consistently use LOWER() for uniqueness validations (rather than mixing with UPPER()) so the database can always use a functional index on the lowercased column. Closes #6495.
pluralize helper interprets nil as zero. Closes #6474.
scaffold_resource generator uses _path named routes and head instead of render :nothing => true. Closes #6545.
SQLite: count(distinct) queries supported in >= 3.2.6, fix calculations workaround, remove count(distinct) query rewrite, cleanup test connection scripts. Closes #6544.
Turns out call_stack slows down the entire app, so just warn that breakpoints don't work with 1.8.5 for now.
Set ActionView::Base.default_form_builder once rather than passing the :builder option to every form or overriding the form helper methods.

The mere existance of a rjs file shouldnt cause the layout to disappear. Made it easier to specify a :with on observer_field
Delay rake:uncommitted's execution of `svn status`
Added simple alert() notifications for RJS exceptions when config.action_view.debug_rjs = true.  Set debug_rjs = true for the default development environment.
Prefer application/xml over text/xml for charset reasons
Rendering xml shouldnt happen inside any layout. Added class proxying to RJS, so you can call page.field.clear("my_field") to generate Field.clear("my_field");. Added :content_type option to render, so you can change the content type on the fly. Do type/subtype reordering of Accept header preferences for xml types (aka make Firefox work with respond_to). CHANGED DEFAULT: The default content type for .rxml is now application/xml instead of type/xml, see http://www.xml.com/pub/a/2004/07/21/dive.html for reason

move vendor inside lib so that rake freeze_edge works
reverted #to_sentence to use red, green, and blue style
Make the 3rd arg optional for #failsafe_response

Make IntegrationTest refer to superclass properties using copy-on-write
Added a backtrace to the evil WSOD (White Screen of Death).  Closes #4073. TODO: Clearer exceptions [Rick Olson]

Dont generate migration when doing scaffolding
allow RJS enum values to be passed to visual_effect() and other scriptaculous helpers #4080 [Rick Olson]
Migrations created alongside models should be called CreateModels not AddModels for consistency with the create/drop notion of tables [Dave Thomas]
Added public/javascripts/application.js as a sample since it'll automatically be included in javascript_include_tag :defaults [DHH] (backed out of -a/--with-assets, not worth it)
Added cascading eager loading that allows for queries like Author.find(:all, :include=> { :posts=> :comments }), which will fetch all authors, their posts, and the comments belonging to those posts in a single query (using LEFT OUTER JOIN) #3913 [anna@wota.jp]
Backed out of that. PStore doesnt support suffix :(
Backed out of that. PStore doesnt support suffix :(

fix unreplaced class var
Revert allow_concurrency change for better testing. Retrieve_connection in two steps to avoid side-effect bug (yuk).

Clear stale, cached connections left behind by defunct threads. Eliminate duplicate connection cache.
CHANGED DEFAULT: set ActiveRecord::Base.allow_concurrency to false.  Most AR usage is in single-threaded applications.

Add Enumerable#group_by and Array#in_groups_of
restore elided TestProcess#assigns method
Make TestProcess methods public for access via Integration::Session. Make return values from some of the Integration::Session methods sane.

Use require instead of load with the integration stuff. Add helper method for creating new sessions.
Update old alias too
When freezing to edge, we should also export railties/bin and railties/html so that rails:update:scripts and rails:update:javascripts still function.

Make clearing follow the object:action naming of the rest of the tasks
Make clearing follow the object:action naming of the rest of the tasks
Make clearing follow the object:action naming of the rest of the tasks
Added support to AssetTagHelper#javascript_include_tag for having :defaults appear anywhere in the list, so you can now make one call ala javascript_include_tag(:defaults, "my_scripts") or javascript_include_tag("my_scripts", :defaults) depending on how you want the load order (closes #3506) [Bob Silva]
Added new column to all db definitions. Where, oh where, is our hereo that will convert all the legacy fixture schemas to schema.rb? (closes #3993) [Bob Silva]

doc fix (closes #3972) [robby]
Dont require association classes before theyre supposed to be used (closes #3976) [Rick Olson]
Added namespaces to all tasks, so for example load_fixtures is now db:fixtures:load. All the old task names are still valid, they just point to the new namespaced names. "rake -T" will only show the namespaced ones, though [DHH]
Define attribute query methods to avoid method_missing calls. Closes #3677.
CHANGED DEFAULT: ActiveRecord::Base.schema_format is now :ruby by default instead of :sql. This means that we'll assume you want to live in the world of db/schema.rb where the grass is green and the girls are pretty. If your schema contains un-dumpable elements, such as constraints or database-specific column types, you just got an invitation to either 1) patch the dumper to include foreign key support, 2) stop being db specific, or 3) just change the default in config/environment.rb to config.active_record.schema_format = :sql -- we even include an example for that on new Rails skeletons now. Brought to you by the federation of opinionated framework builders! [DHH]
Example for validates_presence_of method (closes #3966) [Robby Russell]
ActiveRecord::Base.remove_connection explicitly closes database connections and doesn't corrupt the connection cache. Introducing the disconnect! instance method for the PostgreSQL, MySQL, and SQL Server adapters; implementations for the others are welcome. References #3591.
fix method scoping test for postgresql
Added -r/--repeat option to script/process/spawner that offers the same loop protection as the spinner did. This deprecates the script/process/spinner, so it's no longer included in the default Rails skeleton, but still available for backwards compatibility (closes #3461) [ror@andreas-s.net]
Added support for nested scopes (closes #3407) [anna@wota.jp]
Add around methods to Logger.  Closes #3809

Added calculations: Base.count, Base.average, Base.sum, Base.minimum, Base.maxmium, and the generic Base.calculate. All can be used with :group and :having. Calculations and statitics need no longer require custom SQL. #3958 [Rick Olson]
Added tmp/sessions, tmp/cache, and tmp/sockets as default directories in the Rails skeleton [DHH] Changed the default session configuration to place sessions in tmp/sessions, if that directory is available, instead of /tmp (this essentially means a goodbye to 9/10 White Screen of Death errors and should have web hosting firms around the world cheering) [DHH] Added a default configuration of the FileStore for fragment caching if tmp/cache is available, which makes action/fragment caching ready to use out of the box with no additional configuration [DHH] Changed the default configuration for lighttpd to use tmp/sockets instead of log/ for the FastCGI sockets [DHH]
Added that script/generate model will now automatically create a migration file for the model created. This can be turned off by calling the generator with --skip-migration [DHH]
Prepare order for uncommenting, use consistent opt options [DHH]
Added -d/--database option to the rails command, so you can do "rails --database=sqlite2 myapp" to start a new application preconfigured to use SQLite2 as the database. Removed the configuration examples from SQLite and PostgreSQL from the default MySQL configuration [DHH]
Allow script/server -c /path/to/lighttpd.conf
fix test for postgresql

Added :count option to pagination that'll make it possible for the ActiveRecord::Base.count call to using something else than * for the count. Especially important for count queries using DISTINCT #3839 [skaes]. Added :select option to Base.count that'll allow you to select something else than * to be counted on. Especially important for count queries using DISTINCT (closes #3839) [skaes].
Added SIGTRAP signal handler to RailsFCGIHandler that'll force the process into a breakpoint after the next request. This breakpoint can then be caught with script/breakpointer and give you access to the Ruby image inside that process. Useful for debugging memory leaks among other things [DHH]
test_find_or_create_from_two_attributes is a duplicate of test_find_or_create_from_one_attribute (closes #3863) [jp.bougie@gmail.com]
Also use CWD on document_root (closes #3883) [grant@antiflux.org]

save polymorphic joins from the has_many|one association (closes #3812) [Rick Olson]
Changed default lighttpd.conf to use CWD from lighttpd 1.4.10 that allows the same configuration to be used for both detach and not. Also ensured that auto-repeaping of FCGIs only happens when lighttpd is not detached. [DHH]
The session should be saved even if the filter chain is stopped
Modernize flash tests
Flash shouldnt depend on components either [DHH]
Stopped the massive bleeding of concerns into ActionController::Base. Base no longer knows about flash, filters, or components. This may well have introduced some instability, please do test with apps, especially the ones using components. [DHH]
Add JavaScriptGenerator#replace_element for replacing an element's "outer HTML". Closes #3246.
Add caution and restyle components
The components module should also contain the options that pertain to it, so collect it all with ClassMethods and InstanceMethods

SQLServer: more compatible limit/offset emulation. Closes #3779.
Major components cleanup and speedup. Closes #3527.

Update AR default timezone docs.
SQL Server cannot sort on type text. This causes three errors in the activerecord test suite, where tests sort on the comments.body or posts.body columns. This patch changes these columns from text to varchar(4096), allowing these tests to proceed (and pass). All activerecord tests now pass under sqlserver.  References #3581. [Tom Ward]
Polymorphic join support for has_one associations (has_one :foo, :as => :bar).  Closes #3785.
defaults_test gets a dummy test method so it has at least one test to run

This does not need to be thread local (thanks skaes).
Disabled stderr suppressing until activesupport is available also in non-gem mode
Don't reload routes until plugins have been loaded so they have a chance to extend the routing capabilities [DHH]
Don't cast nil or empty strings to a dummy date.  Closes #2789.
Expand tabs and strip trailing whitespace.
acts_as_list plays nicely with inheritance by remembering the class which declared it.  Closes #2811.
The auto_link text helper accepts an optional block to format the link text for each url and email address.  References #2628.
Don't detach or fork for script/server tailing
Added automatic browser launching on OS X when starting script/server [DHH]

Delete existing sessions with the same session id before creating a new session.  Prevents duplication and hijacking.
CGI::Session::ActiveRecordStore.data_column_name = 'foobar' to use a different session data column than the 'data' default.  References #2731.  Remove error-prone method_missing passthrough to session model.  Cleanup.
Correct handling of complex order clauses with SQL Server limit emulation.  Closes #2770.
Correct whitespace problem in Oracle default column value parsing.  Closes #2788.
Correct versioning in :freeze_gems Rake task.  Closes #2778.
Destroy associated has_and_belongs_to_many records after all before_destroy callbacks but before destroy.  This allows you to act on the habtm association as you please while preserving referential integrity.  Closes #2065.
Deprecate the old, confusing :exclusively_dependent option in favor of :dependent => :delete_all.
Controllers with acronyms in their names (e.g. PDFController) require the correct default helper (PDFHelper in file pdf_helper.rb).  Closes #2262.  Do not raise an exception when default helper is missing; log a debug message instead.  It's nice to delete empty helpers.
More compatible Oracle column reflection.  Closes #2771.
Add :order option to Author.posts_with_comments_and_categories so that tests which assume implicit id order pass with database which do not provide it.  Scrubbed whitespace.
Added an omnipresent RailsInfoController with a properties action that delivers an HTML rendering of Rails::Info (but only when local_request? is true). Added a new default index.html which fetches this with Ajax.
Adding new scripts should set them 0755.
Made ready for 0.14.3 (RC4)
Added in bars to help guard against the production environment being used in test
Add 'add_new_scripts' rake task for adding new rails scripts to script/*

Raise in stubby/init.rb if it doesn't have access to directory or config.  loaded_plugins is a set of plugin names (so it will be usable with multiple paths, gems, etc).
Dont generate config/lighttpd.conf, will be done on first run of script/server
Remove bogus hyphen from script/process/reaper calls to 'ps'.  Closes #2767.

Make sure to check for FCGI as well as lighttpd
Only use a socket if there
Dont have password: optional in there
Dont have password: optional in there
Added default lighttpd config in config/lighttpd.conf and added a default runner for lighttpd in script/server (works like script/server, but using lighttpd and FastCGI).

New configuration option config.plugin_paths which may be a single path like the default 'vendor/plugins' or an array of paths: ['vendor/plugins', 'lib/plugins'].  Plugins are discovered in nested paths, so you can organize your plugins directory as you like.  Refactor load_plugin from load_plugins.  Simplify initializer unit test.  Closes #2757.
Make use of silence_stderr in script/lighttpd, script/plugin, and Rails::Info
Define kernel.rb methods in "class Object" instead of "module Kernel" to work around a Windows peculiarity
Added Kernel#silence_stderr to silence stderr for the duration of the given block.  Changed Kernel#` to print a message to stderr (like Unix) instead of raising Errno::ENOENT on Win32.
Added :include as an option for association declarations [DHH]
Sharper example
Made association extensions use simpler block syntax
Add documentation to assert_tag indicating that it only works with well-formed XHTML
Add a new test case to demonstrate that subject headers are being properly encoded for multipart messages

script/lighttpd: tail the logfile when running in the foreground, and attempt to guess the port number
Added skip_before_filter/skip_after_filter for easier control of the filter chain in inheritance hierachies [DHH] Added short-hand to assert_tag so assert_tag :tag => "span" can be written as assert_tag "span" [DHH]
Added extension capabilities to has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many proxies [DHH] Added find_or_create_by_X as a second type of dynamic finder that'll create the record if it doesn't already exist [DHH] Added constrain scoping for creates using a hash of attributes bound to the :creation key [DHH]

Don't reap spawn-fcgi.  Closes #2727.
Correct the pure-Ruby MySQL 4.1.1 shim's version test.  Closes #2718.
Add Model.create! to match existing model.save! method.  When save! raises RecordInvalid, you can catch the exception, retrieve the invalid record (invalid_exception.record), and see its errors (invalid_exception.record.errors).
Correct fixture behavior when table name pluralization is off.  Closes #2719.
Added extension capabilities to has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many proxies [DHH]
Restore the fast Numeric#blank?  Closes #2714.
Reaper knows how to find processes even if the dispatch path is very long.  Closes #2711.
Correct reader method generation for primary key attribute: handle case when primary_key is defined but its column is nil, such as when the model class is backed by a view.
Changed 0.blank? to false rather than true since it violates everyone's expectation of blankness.  Closes #2518, Closes #2705.
Added redirect_to :back as a short-hand for redirect_to(request.env["HTTP_REFERER"])
Make fcgi handler respond to TERM signals with an explicit exit

If specified, pass PostgreSQL client character encoding to createdb.  Closes #2703.
ensure close_session in AC::Base#process
Failsafe response handler for dispatcher.
Simplify gem search for :freeze_gems rake task.
Move Dispatcher.dispatch CGI.new out of default args and into rescuable block so the dispatcher catches its errors rather than the fcgi handler.
The freeze_gems Rake task accepts the VERSION environment variable to decide which version of Rails to pull into vendor/rails.

Add comment in config/environment.rb explaining $KCODE and UTF-8 #1726 [Leon Bredt]
Improved rendering speed on complicated templates by up to 25% #1234 [Stephan Kaes]. This did necessasitate a change to the internals of ActionView#render_template that now has four parameters. Developers of custom view handlers (like Amrita) need to update for that.
Dropped the 'immediate close-down' of FCGI processes since it didn't work consistently and produced bad responses when it didn't. So now a TERM ensures exit after the next request (just as if the process is handling a request when it receives the signal). This means that you'll have to 'nudge' all FCGI processes with a request in order to ensure that they have all reloaded. This can be done by something like ./script/process/repear --nudge 'http://www.myapp.com' --instances 10, which will load the myapp site 10 times (and thus hit all of the 10 FCGI processes once, enough to shut down).
Allow unspecified join-table columns to use to their default values when adding to a habtm collection

Add test for dynamic dispatch based on action_name accessor.
Post release minor fixes
Remove fix against memory leaks in development mode as it killed development performance on large applications (2-3s stall on Basecamp). Octopod is working on a better fix.
ensure the second manual WS request of scaffolding contains the same state as the original request as much as possible (so that things relying on hostnames &c will keep on working)
fix bug in unit test causing spurious failures, and make sure the unit test requires the Rails libraries from *Source Control* first, or we'll get false positives. add ActiveRecord require to abstract_unit.rb.
Pegged the versions for release
Keep JS files locally
Made documentation ready for release (AR)
Correctly normalize newlines in outgoing emails before encoding the body [John Long]

Move URI to the end for greater overview
Changed logging of SQL statements to use the DEBUG level instead of INFO. Added logging of the request URI in the benchmark statement (makes it easy to grep for slow actions). Changed the default logging level in config/environment.rb to INFO for production (so SQL statements won't be logged)
Routing fix
 r2866@asus:  jeremy | 2005-07-05 13:23:10 -0700  Silence ARStore session activity in the logs.
 r2850@asus:  jeremy | 2005-07-05 13:08:32 -0700  Don't be strict about the order in which AR store methods are called.  Allow e.g. session close followed by session close.

Corrected @@configurations typo.  #1410 [david@ruppconsulting.com]
Return PostgreSQL columns in the order they are declared #1374 (perlguy@gmail.com).  Unit test column order, adapter housekeeping, simplify users of columns_hash.

Don't expect fixtures to be returned in the order they were inserted.
Don't expect fixtures to be returned in the order they were inserted.
Preserve extendedWarranty case in PostgreSQL computers table.
Allow before/after update hooks to work on models with optimistic locking
Do not use instantiated fixtures (in general) in tests. Also, support the use of transactional fixtures by setting the AR_TX_FIXTURES environment variable to "yes".
Eager loading of dependent has_one associations won't delete the association #1212. Also, starting to refactor the tests to make them speedier, with optional support for transactional fixtures.
Arrays sent via multipart posts are converted to strings #1032 [dj@omelia.org]
Silently ignore Errno::EINVAL errors when converting between charsets. Some mail clients apprently send X-UNKNOWN to represent unknown charsets, and this caused the conversion to blow up.
Sort the migration files explicitly so that they are always ordered correctly.
Replace the in-memory object, but dont orphan the existing one
Added a second parameter to the build and create method for has_one that controls whether the existing association should be replaced (which means nullifying its foreign key as well). By default this is true, but false can be passed to prevent it.
Add a test case for malformed email headers
Don't error while processing encoded attachment names #1340 [lon@speedymac.com]
Handle parsing of recursively multipart messages
CSS needs "red" not #red
BCC headers are removed when sending via SMTP
Using transactional fixtures now causes the data to be loaded only once, for BIG speed improvements
Added fixture accessors that can be used when fixture instantiation is disabled, "model_name(:fixture_name)"
Added a "content_type" accessor to allow messages to explicitly specify a content-type other than "text/plain" (the default).
Don't apply a charset to attachments. Wrap base64-encoded lines.
Made Action View work with the new render :file/:partial style from the controller
render(:action) and render() are the only two render calls to use a layout by default. All others default to :layout => false. Also, allow :layout => true to be a synonym for :layout => nil.
fix scaffolding template paths (Pathname does weird things on Win32)
Ignore Iconv::IllegalSequence errors when converting text #1341 [lon@speedymac.com]
render(:inline) defaults to :layout => false
Make sure the benchmarking render method always returns the result of the render, regardless of whether logging is enabled or not.
render(:text), render(:partial), and render(:nothing) always default to :layout => false. This also fixes send_file, which was applying a layout if one existed for the current action.
verify with :redirect_to won't redirect if a redirect or render has already been performed #1350
render(:partial => "...") uses an empty hash for the local assigns #1365. render(:partial => true) is identical to the older render_partial()
Don't die when an attempt to delete a cache fails
A very thorough refactoring, resulting in new mail property setters and support for attachments and multipart messages.
Updated unit test style
Test for no layout on nothing
render :nothing shouldnt cause layouts
Set redirected_to proper
Cure some ills discovered with the refactoring
Deprecated all render_* methods in favor of consolidating all rendering behavior in Base#render(options). This enables more natural use of combining options, such as layouts
Deprecated redirect_to_path and redirect_to_url in favor of letting redirect_to do the right thing when passed either a path or url. Introduced r as a unified method for render (still under construction)
Added note of limitation for #1279
Added Errors#add_on_blank which works like Errors#add_on_empty, but uses Object#blank? instead. CHANGED: validates_presence_of now uses Errors#add_on_blank, which will make "  " fail the validation where it didnt before #1309. Added that "   " is now also blank? (using strip if available)
Slight change to allow custom date/time conversions #1326 [Rick Olson]
Remove unneeded file
Missing file
Added graceful exit from pressing CTRL-C during the run of the rails command #1150 [Caleb Tennis]
Added the :if option to all validations that can either use a block or a method pointer to determine whether the validation should be run or not. #1324 [Duane Johnson/jhosteny]
Made the console and profiler work with the default 1.8.2 profiler #1325 [bitsweat]
Made the post_format work with content-type
Made the post_format work with content-type
Needed for test
Include flash in the list of attributes with accessors in the view
memo to self: add :rest dispatching mode, and vanilla XML message support a.l.a Backpack API...its so Web 2.0 :)
Speed up timestamping a tad #1227 [skaen]
Optimize ActionCacheFilter by using url_for less #1230 [skaen]
Cache relative_url_root and optimize path #1232 [skaen]
Faster action_exempted? #1231 [skaen]
Added Serbia and Montenegro to the country_select #1239 [todd@robotcoop.com]
Added support for descending year values in DateHelper#select_year, like select_year(Date.today, :start_year => 2005, :end_year => 1900), which would count down from 2005 to 1900 instead of the other way #1274 [nwoods@mail.com]
Ajax docing #1282 [Dee.Zsombor@gmail.com]
Push to .org instead
Added accessors to logger, params, response, session, and headers from the view, so you can write <% logger.info "stuff" %> instead of <% @logger.info "others" %> -- more consistent with the preferred way of accessing these attributes and collections from the controller
Update docs to X-POST_DATA_MARSHAL
Use X-POST_DATA_FORMAT instead of just POST_DATA_FORMAT
Added support for POST data in form of YAML or XML, which is controller through the POST_DATA_MARSHAL header
Added support for POST data in form of YAML or XML, which is controller through the POST_DATA_MARSHAL header
Step cautiously around subheaders in TMail #1285 [Jamis Buck]
Go straight to the class for asset_host
Added TextHelper#sanitize that can will remove any Javascript handlers, blocks, and forms from an input of HTML.  This allows for use of HTML on public sites, but still be free of XSS issues. #1277 [Jamis Buck]
add test to ensure the bug fixed by [1295] can't occur again.
fix that functional testing for :layered SOAP would complain that it was not XML-RPC.
support using invocation filters in :direct controllers as well, for consistency. action pack filters don't necessarily include enough information about the request since they occur before AWS actually sees the request and unpacks it.
add base64 signature type (thanks, Shugo Maeda!)
Only gsub on a string
Added functionality to assert_tag, so you can now do tests on the siblings of a node, to assert that some element comes before or after the element in question, or just to assert that some element exists as a sibling #1226 [Jamis Buck]
Changed RAILS_ASSET_HOST to become ActionController::Base.asset_host
Added better error handling for regexp caching expiration
remove usages of @request, @response, @params, and replace with #request, #response, #params, except for test_invoke (values come from the test case) and one scaffold RHTML template.
fix boolean field rendering in scaffolding
fix :delegated invocation in the scaffolding
Made dispatch.fcgi more robust by catching fluke errors and retrying unless its a permanent condition. [Jamis Buck] Allow graceful exits for dispatch.fcgi processes by sending a SIGUSR1. If the process is currently handling a request, the request will be allowed to complete and then will terminate itself. If a request is not being handled, the process is terminated immediately (via #exit). This basically works like restart graceful on Apache. [Jamis Buck]
Treat all request types as upper-case so the switch will work
Made it default to assuming a GET request and reading from command-line only in case of the new CMD method
Added that both AssetHelper#stylesheet_link_tag and AssetHelper#javascript_include_tag now accept an option hash as the last parameter, so you can do stuff like: stylesheet_link_tag "style", :media => "all"
Added FormTagHelper#image_submit_tag for making submit buttons that uses images
Added the option of specifying a RAILS_ASSET_HOST that will then be used by all the asset helpers. This enables you to easily offload static content like javascripts and images to a separate server tuned just for that.
Dont activate the query cache just yet
Improved the silence method on the logger to ensure restoring the old level #1240 [bitsweat
Missing test data
Added automatic decoding of base64 bodies #1214 [Jamis Buck]
Changed that destroying an object will only freeze the attributes hash, which keeps the object from having attributes changed (as that wouldn't make sense), but allows for the querying of associations after it has been destroyed.
Changed the callbacks such that observers are notified before the in-object callbacks are triggered. Without this change, it wasn't possible to act on the whole object in something like a before_destroy observer without having the objects own callbacks (like deleting associations) called first.
Added that delivery errors are caught in a way so the mail is still returned whether the delivery was successful or not
Added silencing to the default Logger class
Dont expire or read fragments if caching is turned off
Dont benchmark if the logger has been turned off
Started work on a per-request query cache
Started work on a per-request query cache
Added option for passing an array to the find_all version of the dynamic finders and have it evaluated as an IN fragment
add support for structured types as input parameters to scaffolding, fixes scaffolding for APIs like metaWeblog that require an input struct (by dropping structs in nested <ul> lists).
Added compatibility with camelCase column names for dynamic finders #533 [Dee.Zsombor]
Added console --profile for profiling an IRB session #1154 [bitsweat]. Changed console_sandbox into console --sandbox #1154 [bitsweat]
Doc fix #1200
A few more tests #1199
Added encoding and min_messages options for PostgreSQL #1205 [shugo]
Added commented out tests for staying either singular or plural on inflection
Check definition on constant not string
Improved the speed of regular expression expirations for caching by a factor of 10 #1221 [Jamis Buck]
Removed dumping of template assigns on the rescue page as it would very easily include a ton of data making page loads take seconds (and the information was rarely helpful) #1222
default to using UTF-8 as response encoding for SOAP if none is supplied, but if an encoding is supplied by caller, use that for the response instead (NAKAMURA Hiroshi)
add charset=utf-8 to SOAP response content type, and make base_uri respect relative_url_root for the endpoint of SOAP messages (Shugo Maeda). if WSDL was retrieved over HTTPS, use HTTPS in the endpoint URLs as well.
add entry for nil casting change
Disregard expire methods when the controller hasnt been set, which essentially makes it such that the record observer callbacks are ignored when the sweeper shouldnt be active
Added descriptions for new caching features
Added BenchmarkHelper that can measure the execution time of a block in a template and reports the result to the log
Added conditions to around_filters just like before_filter and after_filter
Added validates_exclusion_of as a negative of validates_inclusion_of
Optimize counting of has_many associations by setting the association to empty if the count is 0
Prepared for 0.12.1
Dont reload on empty associations
Added xml_http_request/xhr method for simulating XMLHttpRequest in functional tests #1151 [Sam Stephenson]
Update to Prototype 1.2.1
More documentation #1148 [Alisdair McDiarmid]
Added documentation about :limit not working with eager loading
Upload documentation to the new server
Added Base.save! that attempts to save the record just like Base.save but will raise a InvalidRecord exception instead of returning false if the record is not valid [After much pestering from Dave Thomas]
Updated to take compilation out of the measurements
More documentation for .htaccess #1137
Speeded up eager loading a whole bunch
Added support for web servers that use PATH_INFO instead of REQUEST_URI like IIS #1014 [BradG/Nicholas Seckar]
Updated documentation here and there
Added documentation for new Base.find API and eager association loading
Added graceful handling of PUT, DELETE, and OPTIONS requests for a complete coverage of REST functionality #1136 [joshknowles@gmail.com]
Do document this...
Move nodoc to the individual methods
Added that deliver_* will now return the email that was sent
Refactored a bit
Changed habtm eager loading to also use joins
Update to Prototype 1.2.0
add backwards compatibility for the public API change made to #api_methods, as it is being used in some apps.
Made the dynamic finders use the new find API and updated the examples here and there
Added assert_tag and assert_no_tag as a much improved alternative to the deprecated assert_template_xpath_match #1126 [Jamis Buck]
Added Request#xml_http_request? (and an alias xhr?) to that'll return true when the request came from one of the Javascript helper methods (Ajax). This can be used to give one behavior for modern browsers supporting Ajax, another to old browsers #1127 [Sam Stephenson]
SqlServer fixtures - CategoriesPosts
Hide the deprecated methods from the docs
Deprecated the majority of all the testing assertions and replaced them with a much smaller core and access to all the collections the old assertions relied on. That way the regular test/unit assertions can be used against these. Added documentation about how to use it all.
Added the option to specify the acceptance string in validates_acceptance_of #1106 [caleb@aei-tech.com]
Added acts_as_nested_set #1000 [wschenk]
Added acts_as_nested_set #1000 [wschenk]
Added that render_partial called from a controller will use the action name as default #828 [Dan Peterson]
Added Element.toggle, Element.show, and Element.hide to the prototype javascript library. Toggle.display has been deprecated, but will still work #992 [Lucas Carlson]
Added that deleting a cookie should not just set it to an empty string but also instantly expire it #1118 [todd@robotcoop.com]
Added insert_at(position) to acts_as_list #1083 [DeLynnB]
Cleaned up validates_length_of by calling existing validations on the common stuff #1108 [caleb@aei-tech.com]
Dont prefix on updates and deletes, only selects
Added AssetTagHelper#image_path, AssetTagHelper#javascript_path, and AssetTagHelper#stylesheet_path #1110 [Larry Halff]
Clean up load paths to avoid unit test interaction #1113 [alles@atomicobject.com]
Send a stripped down message in the text following 500, and leave the detailed response for the body, or we may generate invalid HTTP responses that causes 404's.
Remove a cause of casting failure for XML-RPC by ignoring structure members not defined in the target type, and perform more sanity checks to make more obvious what the resolution should be when neglecting to provide a valid signature or failing to attach an API to a service implementation class.
Changed render_partial to take local assigns as the second parameter instead of an explicit object and then the assigns
Made migrations create InnoDB tables per default
Honor the order in the new finder
Added script/benchmarker to easily benchmark one or more statement a number of times from within the environment. Added script/profiler to easily profile a single statement from within the environment
Dont initialize the association proxy for nil records
Order by is no longer a guarentee
Qualify the ids used such that eager loading can avoid ambigious keys
Removed the default order by id on has_and_belongs_to_many queries as it could kill performance on large sets (you can still specify by hand with :order)
Improved address header processing
Added submit_to_remote that allows you to trigger an Ajax form submition at the click of the submission button, which allows for multiple targets in a single form through the use of multiple submit buttons #930 [yrashk@gmail.com]
Added Rake target clear_logs that'll truncate all the *.log files in log/ to zero #1079 [Lucas Carlson]
Added :confirm option to link_to_remote just like link_to has #1082 [yrashk@fp.org.ua]
Added minute_step as an option to select_minute (and the helpers that use it) to jump in larger increments than just 1 minute. At 15, it would return 0, 15, 30, 45 options #1085 [ordwaye@evergreen.edu]
Added KLOC counter for AR and AP. Combined theyre at ~9KLOC
Improved tests for NumberHelper
Address parsing failed when the "to" (or "cc", or whatever) was an array. It was also too restrictive in the formats of the addresses #1097 [Jamis]
Made error_messages_for take a symbol as object_name
Moved TextHelper#human_size to NumberHelper#number_to_human_size, but kept an deprecated alias to the old method name
Moved build_association and create_association for has_one and belongs_to out of deprecation as they work when the association is nil unlike association.build and association.create, which require the association to be already in place #864
No conditions relevant here
Dont quote the body
Doc changes
Doc fix
Tests for AS
Added lazy typing for generate, such that ./script/generate cn == ./script/generate controller and the likes #1051 [k@v2studio.com]
Added rollbacks of transactions if they're active as the dispatcher is killed gracefully (TERM signal) #1054 [Leon Bredt]

generate --quiet documentation #715
Added simulation of @request.request_uri in functional tests #1038 [Jamis Buck]
Moved to new server
support SOAP invocation of layered services in scaffolding too, fix bug when method takes no parameters
initial go at making :layered dispatching generate WSDL for SOAP, and have :layered process SOAP method calls correctly as well, may be unstable
Use :foreign_key option if specified on the association
make XMLRPC::FaultException have a #message, otherwise the thrown exception is useless in functional test backtraces
add API::Method#expects_to_hash convenience as well
add API::Method#expects_index_of helper to get the index of a named parameter
be explicit about the object to do #instance_eval in for delegated dispatching, clean up iterations to use #zip (bitsweat),
Made it possible to do text_field :account, :name in addition to text_field "account", "name"
Dont include multiple versions of the same association object
Prefix primary key with table name so it works as part of a joined fetch
don't use SyncEnumerator, its far too slow to be used in something frequently called
More eager fixes
Made eager loading work even more
Allow order, conditions, and joins in finds that include associations
Only include associations when the relevant rows have content
Added tests
Added new Base.find API and deprecated find_all, find_first. Added preliminary support for eager loading of associations
use #rescue_action in WS scaffolding so that exceptions in API methods give a standard Rails error page on failure
remove finished tasks
allow selecting the protocol to use when invoking the scaffolded method. fix bug in walking delegated container services.
filter out embedded nil values for XML-RPC
* collapse 'ws' back into protocols, it just added complexity and indirection, and was hard to extend. * extract casting into seperate support file * ensure casting always does the right thing for return values, should fix interoperability issues with Ecto and possibly other XML-RPC clients * add functional unit tests for scaffolding * represent signature items with classes instead of symbols/Class objects, much more flexible * tweak logging to always show casted versions of parameters and return values, if possible.
Added NumberHelper for common string representations like phone number, currency, and percentage #1015 [DeLynn]
Removed broken attempt to DRY module ClassMethod #970
Automatically extend the class which gets a module included with the ClassMethods module if it exists #970 [Lucas Carlson]

Added assert_no_cookie and fixed assert_cookie_equal to deal with non-existing cookies #979 [bitsweat]
Added that model.items.delete(child) will delete the child, not just set the foreign key to nil, if the child is dependent on the model #978 [bitsweat]
decrease reliance on instantiated fixtures #980 [Jeremy Kemper]
Added :method option to verify for ensuring that either GET, POST, etc is allowed #984 [Jamis Buck]
Added a join parameter as the third argument to Base.find_first and as the second to Base.count #426, #988 [skaes@web.de]
Added options to set cc, bcc, subject, and body for UrlHelper#mail_to #966 [DeLynn]
Made sure all MySQL tables are created as InnoDB
Added install.rbs for all frameworks and made all of them generic enough not to require maintenance #1013, #1012

display the amount of time taken to invoke a scaffolding request
remove ActiveRecordSoapMarshallable, can't reproduce the problem it was intended to fix.
Renamed DateHelper#distance_of_time_in_words_to_now to DateHelper#time_ago_in_words (old method name is still available as a deprecated alias)
first pass of web service scaffolding. add ability to quickly generate an action pack request for a protocol, add missing log_error when we fail to parse protocol messages. add RDoc for scaffolding and functional testing.
Dont load the target before the proxy has had a chance to answer the respond_to? -- this would cause an .empty? query to trigger loading the entire collection if the proxy had already been initialized
remove wrongheaded uses of "rescue nil" if it will mask a useful exception. also include the whole backtrace in the 500 error response body if exception reporting is turned on (the default).
Added Effect.Scale for smoothly scaling images or text up and down #972 [thomas@fesch.at] Added Effect.Squish for scaling down an element and making it disappear at the end #972 [thomas@fesch.at]
Added Effect.Fade which smoothly turns opacity from 100 to 0 and then hides the element #960 [thomas@fesch.at]
don't hide exceptions when we fail to parse XML-RPC messages.
generalize casting code to be used by both SOAP and XML-RPC (previously only XML-RPC). switch to better model for API methods, and improve the ability to generate protocol requests/response, will be required by upcoming scaffolding.
Released 0.11.1
Made ready for the release of 0.11.1
Made ready for better release automation
Added documentation about named bind variables
Added ActionController::Base.page_cache_extension for setting the page cache file extension (the default is .html) #903 [Andreas]

Effects can just be used through the callbacks
Updated to prototype.js 1.1.0
Whitespace flicker

Added fourth option to process in test cases to specify the content of the flash #949 [Jamis Buck]
Added Verifications that allows you to specify preconditions to actions in form of statements like <tt>verify :only => :update_post, :params => "admin_privileges", :redirect_to => { :action => "settings" }</tt>, which ensure that the update_post action is only called if admin_privileges is available as a parameter -- otherwise the user is redirected to settings. #897 [Jamis Buck]
Added other DOM manipulation positions than just replace
Added :highlight effect to do YFT automatically
Added JavascriptHelper#escape_javascript as a public method (was private) and made it escape both single and double quotes and new lines #940 [mortonda@dgrmm.net]
Added trailing_slash option to url_for, so you can generate urls ending in a slash. Note that is currently not recommended unless you need it for special reasons since it breaks caching #937 [stian@grytoyr.net]
Added documentation on models in sessions #929 [c.r.mcgrath@gmail.com]
Removed old UrlWriter methods that are no longer in use after Routes #942
Added TextHelper#human_size for formatting file sizes, like human_size(1234567) => 1.2 MB #943 [thomas@fesch.at]
Copy prototype.js to public/javascripts/ not just public
allow direct dispatching methods to declare their parameters as well, for brevity's sake, it seems to be counter-intuitive not to do so (closes #939). update gem require versions. fix unit tests for exception de-shallowing changes.
Made getElementsByClassName actually work
_at is better for Time.now than _on
Added rescue for missing iconv library and throws warnings if subject/body is called on a TMail object without it instead
Tweaked the rescue with breakpoint, still not perfect
Improved error reporting especially around never shallowing exceptions. Debugging helpers should be much easier now #980 [Nicholas Seckar]
Improved error reporting especially around never shallowing exceptions. Debugging helpers should be much easier now #980 [Nicholas Seckar]

Releasing 0.11.0
Updated more documentation
Added documentation and fixed an ajax bug
Last-minute ajax  fixes #898
Removed SCRIPT_NAME from the WEBrick environment to prevent conflicts with PATH_INFO #896 [Nicholas Seckar] Removed ? from the dispatch.f/cgi redirect line to get rid of 'complete/path/from/request.html' => nil being in the @params now that the ENV[REQUEST_URI] is used to determine the path #895 [dblack/Nicholas Seckar]
Applied the Safari fix on both prototype.js files
fix for javascript_helper.rb build_callbacks #893
Added additional error handling to the FastCGI dispatcher to catch even errors taking down the entire process

Now AssociationCollection#size returns the size of the collection by executing a SELECT COUNT(*) query if the collection hasn't been loaded and calling collection.size if it has. If it's more likely than not that the collection does have a size larger than zero and you need to fetch that collection afterwards, it'll take one less SELECT query if you use length.

Rearranging dependencies
git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@278 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
Moved support into Active Support
git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@276 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
Moved support files into Active Support
Moved the cookies fix to cgi_ext
Moved support from both Action Pack and Active Record into a separate module called Active Support that can be included using svn:externals in both
Added documentation for using render_with_layout
Added Base.default_timezone accessor that determines whether to use Time.local (using :local) or Time.utc (using :utc) when pulling dates and times from the database. This is set to :local by default.
Added the possibility for adapters to overwrite add_limit! to implement a different limiting scheme than "LIMIT X" used by MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite.
Added ActionMailer::Base.deliver_method = :test to the test environment so that mail objects are available in ActionMailer::Base.deliveries for functional testing.
Added ActionMailer::Base.raise_delivery_errors = false to the test environment as we checks will be performed against deliveries array instead.
Added :host and :protocol options to url_for and friends to redirect to another host and protocol than the current.
WordNet not Nets
Touched up wording on the new recommendation stuff for generate models
Added protection for creating a model through the generators with a name of an existing class, like Thread or Date. It'll even offer you a synonym using wordnet.princeton.edu as a look-up. No, I'm not kidding :) [Florian Gross]
Ignore doc and pkg directories
Releasing Rails 0.9.2
Added scope option to validation_uniqueness #349 [Kent Sibilev]
Added allow_nil options to validates_inclusion_of so that validation is only triggered if the attribute is not nil [what-a-day]
Added work-around for PostgreSQL and the problem of getting fixtures to be created from id 1 on each test case. This only works for auto-incrementing primary keys called "id" for now #359 [Scott Baron]
You should redirect externally on the default action
Forgot to include the new session module
Added Base#clear_association_cache to empty all the cached associations #347 [Tobias Luetke]
Added search through session to clear out association caches at the end of each request. This makes it possible to place Active Record objects in the session without worrying about stale data in the associations (the main object is still subject to caching, naturally) #347 [Tobias Luetke]
Added more informative exception when using helper :some_helper and the helper requires another file that fails, you'll get an error message tells you what file actually failed to load, rather than falling back on assuming it was the helper file itself #346 [dblack]
Added more informative exceptions in establish_connection #356 [bitsweat]
The dispatcher should reload the associations AFTER clearing the inheritable variables, not before, or callbacks and others wont work
Added acts instead of mixins
Deal with associated classes that doesnt reside in their own files
Checked in the proper version of const_missing
Forgot a "or" in Inflector
Switched strategy on the id_before_type_cast problem and just did an explicit method so postgresql wouldnt choke on id is null
Added a require_association hook on const_missing that makes it possible to use any model class without requiring it first. Added that Active Record associations are now reloaded instead of cleared to work with the new const_missing hook in Active Record.
Pulling attributes_from_column_definition should set the primary id to nil instead of not at all
Scrap that
Dont define respond_to? lookups for primary key
FormHelper should only use *_before_type_cast if they available on the model
Changed the interface on AbstractAdapter to require that adapters return the number of affected rows on delete and update operations. Added that Base.update_all and Base.delete_all return an integer of the number of affected rows #341
Added that query benchmarking will only happen if its going to be logged anyway #344
Reworded a few doc things for better comprehension [dblack]
Added graceful handling of an inaccessible log file by redirecting output to STDERR with a warning #330 [rainmkr]
Updated the documentation #329 [rainmkr]
Added higher_item and lower_item as public methods for acts_as_list #342 [Tobias Luetke]
Added documentation for automatic layout inclusion #328 [Marcel]
Added support for a -h/--help parameter in the generator #331 [Ulysses]
Added breakpoints to stand-alone Active Record, so we can use them in tests for AR
Set a high default salary within the validation range
Added Developer#salary for the type tests
Added respondence to *_before_type_cast for all attributes to return their string-state before they were type casted by the column type. Added use of *_before_type_cast for all input and text fields.
Added Request#port_string to get something like ":8080" back on 8080 and "" on 80 (or 443 with https).
Added Request#domain (returns string) and Request#subdomains (returns array).
Added POST support for the breakpoint retries, so form processing that raises an exception can be retried with the original request [Florian Gross]
Base#update_attribute isnt subject to validation
Made Base#update_attributes actually work
File.expand_path in config/environment.rb would fail when dealing with symlinked public directories [mjobin].
Added Base#update_attributes that'll accept a hash of attributes and save the record (returning true if it passed validation, false otherwise). Added a return value for Base#update_attribute, so that you get to know whether the save was successful or if it failed validation.
Added Base.destroy and Base.delete to remove records without holding a reference to them first.

Made the last tweaks before 0.9
Updated documentation
Updated documentation
Updated documentation
Updated and added more documentation
Added Base.validates_inclusion_of
Improving documentation...
Renamed Mixins to Acts to resemble the change from include ActiveRecord::Mixins::List to acts_as_list and renamed @@default_error_messagess to @@default_error_messages
Only requests that require processing from a controller should block the webrick server -- requests for stylesheets, images, and the like should be concurrent
Needed to update the server root for the new placement
Renamed script/envcon to script/console
Renamed public/dispatch.servlet to script/server -- it wasn't really dispatching anyway as its delegating calls to public/dispatch.rb
Renamed breakpointing to breakpointer
Added option for turning off the automated timestamps
Added assumption that a Symbol-based scope should end in _id unless it does so already and that you can pass vanilla string-based scopes as a parameter
Added assumption that a Symbol-based scope should end in _id unless it does so already and that you can pass vanilla string-based scopes as a parameter
Make it possible to use a regular scope string in addition to the symbol shortcut
Shouldnt have removed generators from gemspec
Added Base.validates_inclusion_of that validates whether the value of the specified attribute is available in a particular enumerable object. [what-a-day]

Added acts_as_list that can decorates an existing class with methods like move_higher/lower, move_to_top/bottom.
Added that controllers will now attempt to require a model dependency with their name and in a singular attempt for their name.
Added Base.validates_format_of that Validates whether the value of the specified attribute is of the correct form by matching  it against the regular expression provided. [Marcel]
Added Base.default_error_messages as a hash of all the error messages used in the validates_*_of so they can be changed in one place [Tobias Luetke]
git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@172 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
Added automatic transaction block around AssociationCollection.<<, AssociationCollection.delete, and AssociationCollection.destroy_all
Moved generate to bin and included it again
Removed redundent tests for success and removed the tests for missing records that were failing out the gates
Generators shouldnt be placed in a new Rails creation by default
Added Base.validates_boundries_of that delegates to add_on_boundary_breaking #312 [Tobias Luetke]
Make Railties *not* include .svn dirs in its gemspec files list #308 [Marcel]
Documented select, collection_select, and country_select #304 [Ulysses]
Insignificante...
Updated examples to use ApplicationController instead of AbstractApplicationController
Added that controllers will now search for a layout in $template_root/layouts/$controller_name.r(html|xml), so PostsController will look for layouts/posts.rhtml or layouts/posts.rxml and automatically configure this layout if found #307 [Marcel]
Renamed AbstractApplicationController and abstract_application.rb to ApplicationController and application.rb, so that it will be possible for the framework to automatically pick up on app/views/layouts/application.rhtml and app/helpers/application.rb
Brought unit tests up to date
Changed validate_* to validates_*_of, so validate_acceptance becomes validates_acceptance_of, and added :on as a configuration option instead of using _on_create/update
Added tree mixin and unit tests for all the mixins
Wrapped multi-step operations in transactions
fixtures :models will now also attempt to include the model.rb file
fixtures :models will now also attempt to include the model.rb file
Added FormHelper#radio_button to work with radio buttons like its already possible with check boxes [Michael Koziarski]
This patch allows urls to be of the form :module/:controller/:action as well as :controller/:action/:id where :id is no entirely numeric by determining if what would be :module corresponds to a directory in app/controllers. If it does not then the :controller/:action/:id scheme is used.
Added a better exception for when a type column is used in a table without the intention of triggering single-table inheritance. Added that single-table inheritance will only kick in if the inheritance_column (by default "type") is present. Otherwise, inheritance wont have any magic side effects
Cut dependency on dev-utils by using included breakpoint lib
Slightly less overzealous testing
Improved the quality of the breakpointing -- especially under FCGI
Added TemplateError#backtrace that makes it much easier to debug template errors from unit and functional tests
Extended no inclusion of messages if theyre nil to base
Added the option of passing false to :module or :controller_prefix in order to "break out" of a module or prefix
Updated unit tests to reflect lowercase post as method in form tags
Moved methods into the main body as only wiring is needed in append_features
Cleaner deactivation of the breakpoint server
Breakpointing that works much better with CGI and FCGI

Attempted to capture #286 in a unit test, but couldnt get it to fail
Reload the cached column information between requests when the ActionController is set to reloading dependencies
Added methods for resetting the cached information on classes that you want to clear between requests in development mode
Added pattern for specific actions in a modularized controller
Only start the breakpoint server when included by dispatchers
No longer necessary to guard against reincludes with the new reset of inheritance variables
Turn off ACL for localhost
Moved require_association to associations.rb and added methods for resetting the inheritable attributes on subclasses
Display error messages on scaffolded form pages
Superseeded by rails_generator.rb
Added option to ERB templates to swallow newlines by using <% if something -%> instead of just <% if something %>
Remember to include the right breakpoint for the docs
Differentiate breakpointing on gem or not in an attempt to fix looping problems
No longer needed to explicitly pass the session defaults as the error screen was removed
Added that render_partial will always by default include a counter with value 1 unless there is a counter passed in via the local_assigns hash that overrides it. As a result, render_collection_of_partials can still be written in terms of render_partial and partials that make use of a counter can be called without problems from both render_collection_of_partials as well as render_partial #295 [marcel]
Use lower-case post instead of POST as form method for XHTML compliance #290 [Scott Baron]
Mailer generator should create passing tests
Options for the new validation methods are now given as a hash
Added Base.validate_uniqueness thatv alidates whether the value of the specified attributes are unique across the system. Useful for making sure that only one user can be named "davidhh".
Added Base.validate_presence as an alternative to implementing validate and doing errors.add_on_empty yourself. Added _on_create and _on_update versions for all the new validations
Set border on link_to_image to 0 by default

Added validation macros to make the stackable just like the lifecycle callbacks
We need to pass the name when deleting the cookie
Added CookieJar#delete and fixed CookieJar[] to just call first, so you get a string instead of an array back. This limits each cookie to one value, which I consider a mighty fine restriction
A fix that actually works...
Callbacks added to the inheritable que should only be called once -- even as the definition is read again
scope_condition defaults to 1 on list mixin
Added mixins to install.rb
Cleaned up the class_eval stuff in the new mixins a bit
Forgot to include Mixins::Touch by default
Added ActiveRecord::Mixins::Touch that will record creation and update times of objects [xal]
Added ActiveRecord::Mixins::List that can decorates an existing class with methods like move_higher/lower, move_to_top/bottom
Renamed from ListMixin and mixins/list_mixin.rb to Mixins::List and mixin/list.rb

Killed the out of place alias and made sure you can use the different HTTP methods within the same testaction
Only nuke the AbstractApplicationController if its available
Added named bind-style variable interpolation #281 [Michael Koziarski]

Updated Builder to 1.2.2
Added the option for sanitizing find_by_sql and the offset parts in regular finds [Sam Stephenson]
Forgot another small change with the new generators

git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@72 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
New error checking removes the necessity for giving a specific error page along to the dispatcher
Added counter_sql option for has_many associations [bitsweat]
Added the possibility of having validate be protected for assert_(in)valid_column #263 [Tobias Luetke]
Trick tests on url_for
Make the dispatch.rb behave after being run by the WEBrick dispatcher
Added a better generator for scaffolding that actually creates the code, so it can be edited bit by bit. See "script/generate scaffold" [bitsweat]. Added a whole new approach to generators that used the shared "script/generate" command. Run with no-args to see help [bitsweat].
Added that ActiveRecordHelper#form now calls url_for on the :action option.
Documentation bugs
Added all the HTTP methods as alternatives to the generic "process" for functional testing #276 [Tobias Luetke]
Added indifference to whether @headers["Content-Type"], @headers["Content-type"], or @headers["content-type"] is used. Added proper handling of HEAD requests, so that content isnt returned (Request#head? added as well) #277 [Eric Hodel]
Added bind-style variable interpolation for the condition arrays that uses the adapter's quote method [Michael Koziarski]

Syntax errors and other exceptions thrown outside of an action are now gracefully handled by the dispatcher
Cleaned it up
Added an easier way of starting a IRB session on the environment
Added an easier way of starting a IRB session on the environment
git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@47 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
Added extra words of caution for guarding against SQL-injection attacks
Dont include the primary key in updates -- its unneeded and SQL Server chokes on it
Added options to tailor header tag, div id, and div class on ActiveRecordHelper#error_messages_for [josh]
Added proper handling of time fields that are turned into Time objects with the dummy date of 2000/1/1 [HariSeldon]
Added graceful handling of non-alphanumeric names and misplaced brackets in input parameters [bitsweat]
Added reverse order of deleting fixtures, so referential keys can be maintained #247 [Tim Bates]
Added a real reference to the irc channel, and updated the name of the network to the right name in the Rails docs [imajes]
script/new_controller should create directory for views even when no actions are specified [bitsweat]
Added relative path search for sqlite dbfiles in database.yml (if RAILS_ROOT is defined) #233 [bitsweat]
Moved the global require_* out of the classes so they actually work without stack overflows
Abolished ActionController::Base.require_or_load in favor of require_dependency and ActiveRecord::Base.require_or_load in favor of require_association. Both methods are now also available in the global namespace when you need to require dependencies or associations outside of whats done automatically.
AbstractApplicationController and the individual controllers are now completely reloaded on each request if "reload_dependencies" is set to true. This makes it possible to REMOVE methods and constants and have the changes reflected. Beaware that this is still not possible for models, though.
Pass on the original exception
A change in attempt to combat periodical errors with FCGI processes hanging for a long time before returning the response
Silenced warnings from reloading files
Silence errors occurring when reloading classes
git-svn-id: http://svn-commit.rubyonrails.org/rails/trunk@26 5ecf4fe2-1ee6-0310-87b1-e25e094e27de
Handle empty cookie jars gracefully -- dont pout!
Renamed CookieContainer to CookieJar to be cute. Its a private container anyway, so what do you care?
Report to logger when a cookie is set
Allow symbols to be used as names for setting cookies
Allow symbols to be used as keys for setting cookies
Added a new container for cookies that makes them more intuative to use. The old methods of cookie and @cookies have been deprecated.
Added ActionController#cookies[]= as an alias for cookie "name", "value" -- youll still need to use the latter if you have options to set.
Added ActionController#cookies[] as a reader for @cookies that'll return the value of the cookie instead of the cookie object itself. NOTE: If you were using the old accessor, this could potentially break your code -- if you expect a full cookie object!
symbolize_strings_in_hash shouldnt change receiver -- this should fix the bug with dump_schema in the rakefile
Keep quiet about failing to load association classes. People know what theyre doing.
Added the opportunity to defined method_missing on a controller which will handle all requests for actions not otherwise defined #223 [timb]
Put establish_connection back in...
Dont include svn directories in packages
Cleaned up the Rakefile
Consolidated and better commented the environment files
Added option to establish_connection where you'll be able to leave out the parameter to have it use the RAILS_ENV environment variable
Dump development database, not test database
Added Request#ssl? which is shorthand for @request.protocol == "https://"
Allow form_tag with no arguments (resulting in a form posting to current action) - Patch #236
Initial
