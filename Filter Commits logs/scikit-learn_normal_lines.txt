Updating namespace usage from scikits.learn to sklearn
API: scikits.learn -> sklearn
Some minor changes to docs, and small simplification in code. Still need to update docs for hungarian() and find_permutation().
hungarian() now returns a 2-D array of indices instead of a 1-D array. Also modified the find_permutations test to accomodate.
Created an alternative hungarian solver for rectangular matrices that does not involve matrix padding. Also modified the test to test the transpose of the cost matrix as well.
Added support for hungarian assignment problems where one dimension of the cost function is zero-length. The result in such a situation should be an empty array.
An additional check needed in case where there are fewer columns than rows. All assignments are made, but the algorithm wants to keep going because there are some rows left.
This should make the hungarian algorithm accept rectangular cost matrices. Also enabled the tests. NOTE: Only tested on rectangular matrices of shape nxm such that m > n.  Tests need to be expanded to test m < n.

pyflakes/pep8 on coordinate descent
DOC: Link the Olivetti docs in the main docs
fixing up tests
Modified learn.cluster.mean_shift_.py in the following ways: Replaced old seeding strategy with bucket strategy which should be scalable. Modified nearest neighbor lookup to make it more scalable by adding a maximum number of neighbors -- in most cases this will not make a difference in the results --- the impact of this change is tunable with the max_per_kernel parameter.  It is now possible to force all points to belong to a cluster (default) or only those points that are within the bandwidth of a seed (in the flat kernel). Unassigned points are given the cluster index '-1'. Added a parameter to bound the number of iterations for convergence.

Initial commit David Cournapeau <david@ar.media.kyoto-u.ac.jp> | 2006-06-08 17:59:58 +0900 (Thu, 08 Jun 2006)
Add axis arguments to functions that changed in NumPy 1.0b2
remove duplicate definition of __float__
remove unused imports
Run reindent.py (script distributed with Python) over the source to remove extraneous whitespace
Converted scipy to use numpy. Several tests fail but are easily fixed.
More changes to get rid of whrandom usage.
Converted usage of whrandom to random.
New import hooks are applied to cow,ga,sparse. Clean up.
Replaced execfile statements with simplified import statements in order to avoid problems with Windows installer tools.
* Made changes to bring ga up to speed with latest stats module. * fixed remove_NaN function to use a more scipyish solution.
1) Finished applying ppimport hooks to scipy. New scipy import timings on PII 400MHz, Debian with postponed import hooks enabled:
Carried out major unification of xxx/setup_xxx.py files. Discussion: some modules contain setup.py files that repeat the functionality of the corresponding setup_xxx.py files. Are there any objections if setup.py and setup_xxx.py will be merged into setup_xxx.py and setup.py files will be removed from CVS?
Converted module to use 'import' directly, instead of exec 'import...'
Changed == None to is None
Changed references to fastumath to scipy_base.fastumath
Moved shelve to io.  Cleaned up __init__ files.
adding setup_xxx.py files for the new setup.py infrastructure.
added from fastumath import * to all sub-modules in scipy (besides Numeric)
fixed several package related issues with from x import *
attempt at fixing the chaos created by my last checkin.
initial attempt at including Numeric as a sub-package
much clean up of module paths after files were moved.
initial checkin of ga library.
Add axis arguments to functions that changed in NumPy 1.0b2
HTML files for {mlp/rbf/srn}.py generated by pydoc uploaded.
Easier way to select random sample of data for RBF centers.
Updated __init__
Removed two data files.
Updates/refactorings for mlp and srn, addition of rbf.
Heavy refactoring. These are more or less complete now. Small additions remain to make the interface more obvious for users.
more data files for testing
data files for testing
Refactoring SRN based on MLP. Simple 1-step backprop only.
Heavily refactored MLP. Only leastsq used for optimization.
New start with RBF net. Will finish this Sunday.
Minor changes to srn.py. Plans for future dev included in docstrings & comments.
Extensive refactoring of mlp (still convergence probs with some optimization algs). Started work on srn, should commit a good deal more tonight (want to have a working srn with at least one training alg before the weekend).
Implementing error/gradient functions more carefully. Borrowing heavily from Netlab.
- Got least-squares optimization working - Stuck more info into my "test" function to   confirm that leastsq is doing something good - Began incorporating simplex, bfgs and ncg   (added explicit objective fxn for this to work) - discovered dot() and transpose() fxn for arrays... :)   some refactoring of matrix multiplication avoiding   conversions calls to matrix() and array()
Adding data dir with data files.
From: fred.mailhot <fred.mailhot@cb17146a-f446-4be1-a4f7-bd7c5bb65646>
