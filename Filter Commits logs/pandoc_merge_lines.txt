Merge branch 'atlists'.  Added auto-numbered example lists.
Merged branches/context:  addition of a ConTeXt writer <http://www.pragma-ade.nl/>. + Text.Pandoc.Writers.ConTeXt added. + Text.Pandoc modified to export the basic ConTeXt writer. + Main.hs modified to recognize 'context' as a writer. + ConTeXtHeader added to headers + DefaultHeaders.hs template modified to include ConTeXt header + Tests added (writer.context, tables.context), and runtests.pl   modified to run them + pandoc.cabal updated to include Text.Pandoc.Writers.ConTeXt.
Merged changes from 'quotes' branch since r431.  Smart typography is now handled in the Markdown and LaTeX readers, rather than in the writers.  The HTML writer has been rewritten to use the prettyprinting library.
Merged changes from docbook branch since r363.
Merged 'strict' branch from r324.  This adds a '--strict' option to pandoc, which forces it to stay as close as possible to official Markdown syntax.
Merged changes from branches/wrappers since r177. Summary of main changes: + Added -o/--output and -d/--debug options to pandoc. + Modified pandoc to behave differently depending on the name   of the program.  For example, if the program name is 'html2latex',   the default reader will be html and the default writer latex. + Removed most of the old wrappers, replacing them with symlinks   to pandoc. + Rewrote markdown2pdf and created a new wrapper web2markdown,   with the functionality of the old html2markdown script.  These   new scripts exploit pandoc's -d option to avoid having to do   complex command-line parsing. + Revised man pages and documentation appropriately.
Merged changes to footnotes branch r219-r240.
Merge changes in branches/wrappers into trunk.
Merge trunk with ghc66-branch.
