Now creates _<directory> for each post type (e.g. _posts, _pages, _attachments)
Drafts are now marked as published:false
Sometimes wp:post_name can be empty (e.g. when a post is still draft), in this case we make up an appropriate permalink_title that will be used as the filename. The importer can always rename the file later on, and at least the file is unlikely to have been overwritten by another draft on the same day.
Added meta tag import goodness. This for instance allows you to preserve all your hard-worked on WP SEO keywords, images, alternative images and other yummy-ness. Replaced PubDate with wp:post_date, this is better than PubDate since some of the posts you import could be a draft (in this case the pubDate is invalid and contains a non-sensical value). Added wp:status so we now know whether the post is published, draft or in the trash. Added wp:post_type so we differentiate between posts and image or other post types

Changed the date used by Jekyll to be the date the post was authored on instead of the date it was created. If the latter is used on an imported post, it gets the import date instead of the date the post was originally written.
Added code to change the extension of a post based on the format used to write the post in MT.
