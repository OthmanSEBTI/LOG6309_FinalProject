Some more AV work:   * rename _render_partial to _render_partial_unknown_type to reflect that for this call,   	we don't know the type.   * Merge _render_partial_with_block and _render_partial_with_layout to _render_partial     * TODO: Check to see if any more logic can be shared     * TODO: See about streamlining block path so we can get rid of @_proc_for_layout   * Remove @exempt_from_layout as it is no longer needed
