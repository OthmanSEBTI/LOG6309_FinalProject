Fixing ticket #1008, removing tryWithLock
1. Fixed problems with actor fail-over migration. 2. Readded the tests for explicit and automatic migration 3. Fixed timeout issue in FutureSpec
1. Makes sure to check if 'akka.enabled-modules=["cluster"]' is set before checking if the akka-cluster.jar is on the classpath, allowing non-cluster deployment even with the JAR on the classpath 2. Fixed bug with duplicate entries in replica set for an actor address 3. Turned on clustering for all Multi JVM tests
1. Added configuration option for 'preferred-nodes' for a clustered actor. The replica set is now tried to be satisfied by the nodes in the list of preferred nodes, if that is not possible, it is randomly selected among the rest. 2. Added test for it. 3. Fixed wrong Java fault-tolerance docs 4. Fixed race condition in maintenance of connections to new nodes
1. Changed the internal structure of cluster meta-data and how it is stored in ZooKeeper. Affected most of the cluster internals which have been rewritten to a large extent. Lots of code removed. 2. Fixed many issues and both known and hidden bugs in the migration code as well as other parts of the cluster functionality. 3. Made the node holding the ClusterActorRef being potentially part of the replica set for the actor it is representing. 4. Changed and cleaned up ClusterNode API, especially the ClusterNode.store methods. 5. Commented out ClusterNode.remove methods until we have a full story how to do removal 6. Renamed Peter's PeterExample test to a more descriptive name 7. Added round robin router test with 3 replicas 8. Rewrote migration tests to actually test correctly 9. Rewrote existing round robin router tests, now more solid 10. Misc improved logging and documentation and ScalaDoc
Fixed broken support for automatic migration of actors residing on crashed node. Also hardened the test for automatic migration of actors.
Fixed problems with actor migration in cluster and added tests for explicit actor migration through API

Fixed implicit deadlock in cluster deployment
Fixed remaining issues in pluggable serializers (cluster impl)
1. Removed implicit scoped timeout in ? method. Reason: 'pingPongActor.?(Ping)(timeout = TimeoutMillis)' breaks old user code and is so ugly. It is not worth it. Now user write (as he used to): 'pingPongActor ? (Ping, TimeoutMillis)' 2. Fixed broken Cluster communication 3. Added constructor with only String arg for UnhandledMessageException to allow client instantiation of remote exception

Fixed wrong import in multi-jvm-test.rst. Plus added info about where the trait resides.
1. Added docs on how to run the multi-jvm tests 2. Fixed cyclic dependency in deployer/cluster boot up 3. Refactored actorOf for clustered actor deployment, all actorOf now works
