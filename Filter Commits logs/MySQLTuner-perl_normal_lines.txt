Bumped version number to 1.1.1
Added AIX 5L support (patch from Baptiste M. via the blog) Adjusted the version number (should have been done for the 1.1.0 tagged release)
Added in a check for users without passwords and check for slaves running with read_only disabled (patch from Isart Montane)
Forgot to change the old assembla svn note in the script over to github. :|
Added the GPLv3 license along with the script.
Expanded README
Test commit.
Added README file for github prettyness.
Version bump to 1.1.0 Added git tag 'v1.1.0
A warning is now provided if if the query_cache_size goes over 128M. (Thanks to Tim Soderstrom)
When counting index size for MyISAM tables, the INFORMATION_SCHEMA query included all engines. (Thanks to Tom Krouper)
Version bump to 1.0.0 Small spelling correction Contributors list updated
Version bump to 0.9.8 Added new options to help output Made version checking off by default, enabled by --checkversion option
Version bump to 0.9.5 Support is now available for remote servers Can force the script to assume that a certain amount of memory is present (thanks Jason!) Usernames and passwords can now be passed on the command line Added Jason Gill to the contributors list
Version bump to 0.8.9 Added an option to skip the enumeration/sizing of tables (--skipsize), which should help on servers with lots of tables Changed the table enumeration/sizing method for MySQL 5 to use information_schema (increased performance drastically) Adjusted the query_cache_limit recommendation to include the currently set value, rather than 1M each time Changed the wording for tmp_table_size/max_heap_table_size to make it less confusing
Version bump. Added Shawn Ashlee to contributors.
Added lines between sections to increase readability. Corrected a bug where storage engine statuses were still in color even with --nocolor. Excluded information_schema tables from calculations (they were showing up as usual MEMORY tables).
Corrected the total key buffer calculation when symlinks are used Went to traditional versioning scheme starting at 0.8.0
Version bump
Removing a minor left over comment
Version bump and tab fix
Added lots of InnoDB support Flipped spaces to tabs Added more storage engine checks Adjusted output display
* Changed indexing calculations so that all tables are not opened in MySQL 5 (thanks Jon!) * Adjusted some of the commented lines at the top of the script
* Added NetBSD support (thanks to Dave Burgess) * Switched username/password prompts to STDERR so they won't appear in printouts
* Adjusted infoprint to use asterisks (cosmetic) * Per-thread/global buffer counts are now displayed * Key buffer increases are only recommended if the buffer is smaller than total indexes and key buffer hit rate is < 95% * Dropped max_seeks_for_key checks * Temporary table size increases are not recommended over 256M * Aborted connection calculation and recommendation adjustments
Very small bugfix for MySQL 3.23 on line 408
Added aborted connection checks Added % reads/writes counts Adjusted recommendations for slow query logging, max seeks per key, and joins without indexes
Minor fix if no selects have been run (Thanks Kevin)
Minor divide by zero error in query cache calculations
Tremendous overhaul of massive proportions. Thanks to suggestions from Mike Jackson, BK Box, Bryan Tholen, and Shawn Ashlee. MySQLTuner's new home is now at: http://rackerhacker.com/mysqltuner/ The big feature changes will be documented there.
Adjusted key_buffer_size logic checks.\nChanged max_connections wording.\nAdded max_seeks_for_key check.
Added explanations for key max_connections and fixed a Plesk bug when you run the script as a non-root user
Added option to disable colors. Explanation option is disabled by default.
Completed long explanation portion for slow query log section. Created 'explainonly' command line argument for long explanations only. Adjusted memory usage long explanation.
Initial verbose explain output configuration (there you go Mike!)
Massive changes... output filtering, usage information, and temporary table corrections with regards to max memory calculations
Changed all prints to use subroutines to allow for exclusions via command line arguments (coming up next)
Script now requires MySQL 4.1 or higher (4.0 is EOL, and support for that is lame...)
Corrected memory calculation issue in OS X / Darwin
Added check to see if MySQL is even installed
