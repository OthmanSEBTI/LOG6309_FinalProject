Various fixes / improvements: with the new scheme multiple renamings will not waork, so check for them. Fix abortive renames (with a copy of the mnesia dir). Ensure we don't talk to any other nodes while backing up / restoring since that inevitably goes wrong. Split up rename/2 a bit and rename a few other things for more clarity.
Fix bookkeeping of ram_msg_{count,bytes} - don't assume it decrements on alpha -> beta transition, allow it to decrement on beta -> delta as well if the message went to the QI. (We were already correct on delta -> beta, and there isn't a bulk beta -> alpha move.)

Improve tests. Fix some defects in the tests where we assume everything happens at time 0, modify the emission of fine stats so we emit them all in one go for a single channel (like real channels do) and add a test where things happen at different times. This fails against stable, and passes on this branch.
Don't persist gm_pids; by definition when all we have is the rabbit_durable_queue record the cluster has gone down completely so there can't be any pids. Fixes gm_pids leak. Since we're here, fix a similar but less severe leak in sync_slave_pids. (Less severe because rabbit_mirror_queue_misc:store_updated_slaves/1 has the effect of cleaning it up periodically. But it's still wrong.)

(Incidentally) Fix use of /tmp instead of $TMPDIR, aka run tests on a Mac.
revise nack handling in queue (for dlx) - with the changes introduced in bug 24750, the "lost" message count   logged was misleading since it would not include any messages still   pending confirmation from other queues. Fix that. - normal queue terminations are not log worthy - splitting log information across two entries loses context,   i.e. other log entries might appear inbetween. So now we collate all   the information into a single log entry. - saying that messages were "lost" is misleading - we simply don't   know what happened to them. Make this clear(er).

Fix docs
Fix index files for directories, and redirecting.
Fix race. Use cast. No "hello".
Fix upgrades from 2.4.1 and before. This failed because the #exchange{} record now contains the exchange scratch space, but at the point at which we add trace exchanges Mnesia hasn't got there yet. The moral of this story is: never use record definitions in rabbit_upgrade_functions (which is why all the transform() invocations don't).
Dialyser points out that pid_of/1 was returning the wrong thing, hence some tests were passing incorrectly. Fix dubious test.

So those tests should have failed long ago when I removed send_oct et al from /overview, but... Erlang claims 0 < undefined. I disagree. Fix that, and make sure we would catch bug 23551 if it happened again.
Fix receiving - we need a version of send_command_and_notify that doesn't use a content frame.

Fix updating. Only elements marked "updateable" get updated, so doesn't interfere with forms. Allow frequency of updates to be selected.
Fix the {function_clause,[{proplists,get_value,[rate,0,unknown]}... problem. Testign this requires makign the DB tests support an arbitrary number of stages.
Fix non-ASCII characters in names, unused variables. TODO.
Fix some cases where results of amqp_request got trampled on.
Fix a minor bug introduced by Matthias.
Fix some unused variable warnings.
Fixed the bug. The problem was that I was not removing msgs from the index for the dest in a gc if they had a refcount of 0. Thus they could later be reincremented. I was also thoughtlessly doing an index_delete_by_file on the src post gc, which should be unnecessary - 0 refcounts are now removed as they're discovered, and non-zero will be updated to be in the dest. This leaves only 1 worrying use of index_delete_by_file which is now in delete_file_if_empty. Here, scanning and deleting as we find msgs will be constant time and simple. Note this also features a very rough hacking out of the use of contiguous top in GC which turns out to be essential for this bug. However the real fix for that will be in bug 23233 which will block this bug.
MSIE does not correct these capitalisations, and webmachine gets confused. Fix.

Fix testing for variables so that you get as many errors as possible at the same time. This solves the very annoying problem of a build dying for some reason, then you fix the reason, build again, and end up with a very slightly different error at the same point.
Fix up direct connections to use the queue collector process to stay compatible with the server.
Fixing up coverage - it would appear the coverage is *very* sensitive about how it gets started
Fixed recursive delete - it now takes a list of paths, and it deletes directories it comes across
Fix the refactoring which broke bpqueue
Fixes
Fix a leak in the fhc - all clients of the fhc now have a monitor created for them to enable us to tidy up after the process dies. The distinction between these monitors and the ones created in release_on_death is that the release_on_death ones are not stored in the client_mrefs dict, thus if a monitor DOWN message appears which we can't find in that dict, it is assumed it is a release_on_death monitor
Large accountancy bug in queue index leading to great confusion and indeed infinite loop. Fixed.
Fixed a leak - if we have many queue index segments which were written to disk but contained only references to transient messages then on restart, they would never be removed. Unfortunately, this does potentially introduce further work on startup (the queue will try to ensure that it loads the persistent contents of the first segment which contains a persistent message, which can involve scanning through a lot of segments. However, this is actually pretty quick. The only way to fix this would be to keep per segment counters of persistent messages and ensure that's written to disk too, but the extra code cost and complexity may make this just not worth it.
Fix some mistakes that were in the Windows Service documentation.
Fixes to limiter - logic mistake in maybe_notify and some refactoring and cosmetics
Fix breakage of usage introduced in 600668c4da36.
Fix a couple of mistakes noticed by Matthias.
Fix internal links in the generated page.
Fix up things that dialyze complains about
Fix potential leak in cur file cache if the msg is both already known and in a different file - eg same msg gets added to 2 queues, one very long, the other very short. Then memory becomes tight. By the time the short file pushes msg to disk, cur file may well have rolled over
Fix all sorts of concurrency races in the concurrent readers versus GC
Fix rabbitmq-multi issue with parentheses in path
Fixed. If the env vars are not set, combine them from the .conf file (non-RABBITMQ_-prefixed). In the case of one set but not the other, use the DEFAULT_ values.
Fixup specs.
Fixes as suggested. Having tested, the asroot wrapper is used only with activate/deactivate, which don't take any arguments anyway, making testing argument passing a little challenging. However, minor editing of those scripts suggests that it does indeed seem to work.
Fixed. There was a choice of having the qi do its own seqids, which would have been fine, but for the fact that at any point, there is the possibility of the vq deciding to flush everything out to disk. Thus to avoid rewriting in order to preserve order, instead we cope with the fact that there may be partial segments. The solution is to have a dict of segments which received fewer than the expected number of publishes before a different segment was written to. Then, when adding acks, we check to see if the number of acks is now equal to the partial number of segments, if it is, delete. Also, when moving to a different segment, we potentially delete the seg file if the number of acks is equal to the number of publishes. One key aspect of this is that the current segment to which we are publishing never appears in this dict, so it is not possible to delete the current publish segment by having the same number of pubs and acks, without it being really really full. Added and modified tests accordingly.
Fixed bug in the app descriptor
subtle bug in queue_index in that there's a sort of race because scattering the journal out to the segments can cause the publish file handle to be closed, should the segment become full. Fixed.
Fixed a few bugs in fhc, pushed fhc through to msg_store and msg_file. API change to fhc:position to match file, also extended fhc with copy. msg_store must also trap exits so that it will shut down cleanly - especially important given that data to be written is now cached more aggressively. Removal of stop from msg_store as it's part of a supervisor and so the correct way to stop it is via the supervisor.
Fixed tabs.
Fixed formatting for string-based errors
Fixed spelling
Fixed the mistake Matthias spotted in recovery from crash (comment #211). Tested by deliberately breaking the compaction in a variety of ways and then coverage and startup and ensuring the correct code paths are taken.

Fixed handling of symlinks; compacted list comprehensions
Fixed variable name - changed from UNPACKED to EXPAND for consistency
Fixed a bug in the mixed_queue which could lead to messages being marked undelivered when in fact they have been delivered when converting to disk_only mode. In truth, this bug didn't exist because there is no way in which a message could end up in that form in the mixed_queue which had previously been delivered. However, that will change when the prefetcher comes in, necessitating this "bug" gets fixed.
Fixed the commit bug. Really this should probably be in bug20470 but I really didn't want to have to deal with merging and the other information about this bug is in the above comments in 20980 so it's in here.
Fixed hardcoded RPC path
Fixed bug when constructing ez files
Fixes from removing the non-contiguous sequences support from the disk queue that I failed to spot last night, but apparently came to me during my dreams. I have no idea how the tests managed to pass last night...
Fix off-by-one error (discovered by Matthias)
Fixing up escaping of commandline arguments
Fixing invalid call to erlang:exit/1
sorted out the disk_queue tests which had been left behind with the last set of API changes. By fixing them, discovered a bug in the disk queue. Also made the tests a little more rigorous, and discovered a the rdq_stress_gc test was not doing anything like what I'd wanted. Fixed.
Yup, basically, same bug in three places. Fixed. It all works.
Formatting only. Only just realised emacs was using tabs. Fixed.

Fix for that bug. Basically, mnesia wasn't being deleted correctly, which meant on the subsequent startup, it would report messages which we couldn't find anywhere, as they'd been deleted from disk.
