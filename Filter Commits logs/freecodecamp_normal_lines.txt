Attempted to make the nav bar closer in style to the old beta site / current main site. Adjusted the font weights, the size and position of the search bar, and the nav bar on the right. Also made the <li> tags for the curriculum and forum buttons clickable and change styles when hovered over, just like on the main freecodecamp.org site.

Put content in Project Euler stub
Removed the base tag from the header of the preview iframe. The href and target attributes were causing links within the iframe to open a new tab and would point to /, which created problems with some challenges where users should link to other page elements like a footer.
Did some retooling and was able to disable MathJax for the entire page from a top-level div by adding the class name tex2jax_ignore. Brought the dasherize function into Show.js and used it to pass a new prop section down through Side-Panel.js into Challenge-Description.js to add a section class name to each of the challenge-instructions divs. Then was able to use the delimiters that caused problems before, but only for the Rosetta Code challenges.
Reimplemented MathJax with custom `$inlineMath$` delimeters to prevent it from rendering SASS and other challenge descriptions as math functions.
Renabled MathJax and testing default 3324 delimeters to see if other challenge descriptions break.
Added a few styles to increase heirarchy of curriculum list

add revisioning to js/css files to break caching This moves the location of javascript files, commonFramework, iFrameScript, sandbox, plugin, and all the less files. On gulp or gulp build these files are moved and revisioned. Places where they are references in jade/html are now removed and replaced with the use of a helper function `rev`. This function will take the required file and return a string referencing the revisioned file. This should alleviate the need for hard refreshing and will break caches when files change, so fixes for firefox caching issue as well.
