Fix posix_setrlimit() to use int as values instead of strings. Add constant for unlimited (POSIX_RLIMIT_INFINITY).
Fixed situation, when CHECH_EXCEPTION() might change value of "opline" variable and the following "opline" useages would access elements of different opcode. That might lead to unpredictable behavior. (Only PHP-7 with GCC global register variables was affected). CHECK_EXCEPTION() macro is removed. ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE_CHECK_EXCEPTIO() should be used instead. It's equivalent to old CHECK_EXCEPTION() + ZEND_VM_NEXT_OPCODE(). As a side effect, this also slightly improved performnce of builds with GCC >= 4.8.

Fixed test. Apparently it was already fixed on PHP_5_3 98% of the cases and the fix wasn't ported to trunk/PHP_5_4. However the very same test was failing on my FreeBSD 6.2 box, that appears to also decode the "ks_c_5601-1987" parts, so I've made the test more generic.

Fix valgrind error (sending of initialized bytes over the network). When the compression was successful the compressed data + uninitialized data at the end was sent to the server, because the length of the compressed payload wasn't correctly calculated (actually the length of the uncompressed payload as assumed). However, the uncompress() function has internally the length of the real payload and skips the binary trash at the end - thus no data damage occurs!

The parent constructor call #check is performed at construction time by using a wrapper constructor #instead of a check on the beginning of each instance method. #Perhaps this should be uniformized in trunk; this method was mainly #applied only to the ones crashing, except a few iterators (at least #AppendIterator and RecursiveIteratorIterator).

- Completed rewrite of html.c. Except for determine_charset, almost nothing   remains. - Fixed bug on determine_charset that was preventing correct detection in   combination with internal mbstring encoding "none", "pass" or "auto". - Added profiles for entity encode/decode for HTMl 4.01, XHTML 1.0, XML 1.0   and HTML 5. Added the constants ENT_HTML401, ENT_XML1, ENT_XHTML and   ENT_HTML5. - htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars(), when told not to double encode, verify   the correctness of the existenting entities more thoroughly.   It is checked whether the numerical entity represents a valid unicode code   point (number is between 0 and 0x10FFFF). If using the flag ENT_DISALLOWED,   it is also checked whether that numerical entity is valid in selected   document. In HTML 4.01, all the numerical entities that represent a Unicode   code point (< U+10FFFFFF) are valid, but that's not the case with other   document types. If the entity is not valid, & is encoded to &amp;.   For named entities, the check is also more thorough. While before the only   check would be to determine if the entity was constituted by alphanumeric   characters, now it is checked whether that entity is necessarily defined for   the target document type. Otherwise, & is encoded to &amp;. - For html_entity_decode(), only valid numerical and named entities (as defined   above for htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars() + !double_encode) are decoded.   But there is in this case one additional check. Entities that represent   non-SGML or otherwise invalid characters are not decoded. Note that, in   HTML5, U+000D is a valid literal character, but the entity &#x0D is not   valid and is therefore not decoded. - The hash tables lazily created for decoding in html_entity_decode() that were   added recently were substituted by static hash tables. Instead of 1 hash   table per encoding, there's only one hash table per document type defined in   terms of unicode code points. This means that for charsets other than UTF-8   and ISO-8859-1, a conversion to unicode code points is necessary before   decoding. - On the encoding side, the ad hoc ranges of entities of the translation   tables, which mapped (in general) non-unicode code points to HTML entities   were replaced by three-stage tables for HTML 4 and HTML 5. This mapping   tables are defined only in terms of unicode code points, so a conversion   is necessary for charsets other than UTF-8 and ISO-8859-1. Even so, the   multi-stage table is much faster than the previous method, by a factor   of 5; the conversion to unicode is a small penalty because it's just a   simple table lookup.   XML 1.0/htmlspecialchars() uses a simple table instead of a three-stage   table. - Added the flag ENT_SUBSTITUTE, which makes htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars()   replace the invalid multibyte sequences with U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#FFFD;   (other encodings). - Added the flag ENT_DISALLOWED. Implements FR #52860. Characters that cannot   appear literally are replaced by U+FFFD (UTF-8) or &#FFFD; (otherwise).   An alternative implementation would be to encode those characters into   numerical entities, but that would only work in HTML 4.01 due to limitations   on the values of numerical entities in other document types. See also the   effects on htmlentities()/htmlspecialchars() with !double_encode above.

- PHP uses a big endian representation when it converts the   code unit sequences to integers so as to store the entity   maps. Code in traverse_for_entities assumed little   endian. Fixed.   (in practice, due to the absence of unicode and entity   mappings for multi-byte encodings -- except UTF-8 --, this   doesn't matter, so the relevant code was commented out for   performance reasons).
- Removed redundant local variable in dns_get_record. - (5.3) Fixed bug in the Windows implementation of   dns_get_record, where the two last parameters wouldn't be   filled unless the type were DNS_ANY (Gustavo).
- Removed redundant local variable in dns_get_record. - (5.3) Fixed bug in the Windows implementation of   dns_get_record, where the two last parameters wouldn't be   filled unless the type were DNS_ANY (Gustavo).
- [DOC] Added a 5th parameter to dns_get_record, a boolean that tells whether to activate   "raw mode". In this mide, $type (2nd parameter) is the numeric type of the record, and   the responses are not parsed -- the "type" element will be numeric and there will be   a "data" element with the raw data of the response buffer, which the programmer will   have to parse. - Fixed bug in the Win32 implementation of dns_get_record, where the 3rd and 4th arguments   would only be filled if the 2nd ($type) was DNS_ANY. - [DOC] The 3rd and 4th parameters can now be NULL (changed their arginfo).
- Revamp of the decoding portion of html.c. - Dramatic improvements on the performance of html_entity_decode and htmlspecialchars_decode, as the   string is now traversed only once. Speedups of 20 to 25 times with Windows release builds and a   ~250 characters string (for 2nd and subsequent calls). - Consistent behavior on html_entity_decode. For instance, the entity in "&&lt;" would be decoded,   but not "&&#233;". Not anymore. The code path for "basic" and non-basic entities is now mostly   shared. - Code of html_entity_decode and htmlspecialchars_decode is now shared. - [DOC] More consistent behavior of htmlspecialchars_decode. Instead of translating only &lt;, &gt;,   &amp;, &quot;, &#039; and &#39;, now e.g. &#34;, &apos;, &#0039;, &#x27;, etc. are also decoded. - [DOC] Previous translation of unicode code points in numerical entities was seriously broken. When   the code points for some character were not the same in unicode and the target encoding, the   behavior could be an erroneous translation (e.g. 0x80-0xA0 in win-1252) or no translation at all.   Added unicode translation tables for all single-byte encodings. Entities are not translated for   multi-byte entities, except for ASCII characters whose code points are shared. We could add   the huge translation tables (several thousand elements) for those encodings in the future. - Fixed numerical entities that after # had text accepted by strcol being accepted. - Much more commented and well-structured code... - Tests for get_html_translation_table()) are broken. I stared fixing the tests, but then I realized   it was completely helpless because get_html_translation_table() is broken by not handling   multi-byte characters correctly.

- Fixed bug #52981 (Unicode casing table was out-of-date).   Updated with UnicodeData-6.0.0d7.txt and included the   source of the generator program with the distribution. #The replaced tables, generated circa 2002, seem to reflect #Unicode 3.2. I was unable to generate the same property #offsets with Unicode 3.2 data, but all the tests I made #indicate php_unicode_is_prop() is returning the correct #values. The replaced file merely says it used a "modified #version" of ucgendat, which is not very helpful. The results #I got were not significantly different, only slightly higher #offsets at two properties, which were carried over to the #subsequent properties. #I was, however, able to replicate precisely the casing table. #The extent of the "modifications" besides omitting most of #the tables, a slightly different layout and the casing table #offsets having been multiplied by 3 is unclear. #The test suite showed no regressions; however, it's very poor #in testing the modified portion of the extension.

Fix tests that fail when the MySQL's socket file is not /tmp/mysql.sock as it is in when compiled from source and the default for mysqlnd. SuSE for example uses /var/run/mysql/mysql.sock . Also, sql.safe_mode (ext/mysql and ingres) needs the socket. Fix possible crashes in mysqlnd. When packets are shorter, functions should return error.

Fix a bug that a statement that is reset doesn't clean the wire properly (as it is done when the statement is closed). If there is more that one result sets returned from the PS (like a call to SP that returns at least one RSet next to the status rset) then the line was blocked. PS Multi-Res is not supported in any libmysql from a GA-ed MySQL.

Fix (by Andrey) and test for bug #49442 . Don't use efree() for memory allocated with malloc()... If a connection gets created by mysqli_init(), mysqlnd makes it 'persistent'. 'Persistent' means that mysqlnd uses malloc(). mysqlnd does use malloc() instead of ealloc() because it is unknown if the connection will become a true persistent connection in the sense of ext/mysqli. It is unknown if the user wants a persistent connection or not until the user calls mysqli_real_connect(). To avoid tricky conversions mysqlnd uses malloc(), which sets a private persistent flag in the mysqlnd structures. A precondition for the crash to happen was that the private persistent flag is set. The flag is also set when creating a real persistent connection (in the sense of ext/mysqli) and so the bug can happen with mysql_init()/mysqli_real_connect() and mysql_connect('p:<host>', ...). Therefore we test both cases. Note the (tricky?) difference between the implementation detail'mysqlnd private persistent flag = use malloc()' and persistent connections from a user perspective. Although mysqlnd will always set its private persistent flag and  use malloc() for connections created with mysqli_init() it is still up to the user to decide in mysqli_real_connect() if the connection shall become a (true) persistent connection or not.

Fix and tests for bug #49511 . mysqlnd and the MySQL Client Library (libmysql) use different networking APIs. mysqlnd does use PHP streams whereas libmysql uses its own wrapper of the operating level network calls. PHP sets by default a read timeout of 60s for streams - php.ini, default_socket_timeout. This default applies to all streams that set no other timeout value. mysqlnd has not set any other value and therefore it connections of long running queries can have been cut off after default_socket_timeout seconds resulting in a 2006 - MySQL Server has gone away error message. The MySQL Client Library sets a default timeout of 365 * 24 * 3600 seconds (1year) and waits for other timeouts to happen, e.g. TCP/IP timeouts. mysqlnd now uses the same very long timeout. The value is configurable through a new php.ini setting: mysqlnd.net_read_timeout. mysqlnd.net_read_timeout gets used by any extension (ext/mysql, ext/mysqli, PDO_MySQL) that uses mysqlnd. mysqlnd tells PHP Streams to use mysqlnd.net_read_timeout. Please note that there may be subtle differences between MYSQL_OPT_READ_TIMEOUT from the MySQL Client Library and PHP Streams. E.g. MYSQL_OPT_READ_TIMEOUT is documented to work only for TCP/IP connections and, prior to MySQL 5.1.2, only for Windows. PHP streams may not have this limitation. Please check the streams documentation, if in doubt.

MFH: Fix two problems: - The value of mysqli_get_client_info() has been changed recently and did not include "mysqlnd" anymore thus the test suite was thinking the build is always libmysql. This did not kept the suite from running pconn tests - Going back to the libc allocator because the memory arena could be on a   persistent connections. If the build is not debug there will be no error   but the memory will be freed and in the second use of this pconn freed   memory will be used - not good! For now the arena doesn't take an argument   whether it should allocate persistently or not, thus persistent is safe   for now.

MFH - 'Fixing' test to reflect a libmysql vs. mysqlnd difference. With libmysql it is not defined what mysql_stmt_store_result() shall return when one tries to store the (non-existing) result set of a failed SQL statement, http://dev.mysql.com/doc/refman/6.0/en/mysql-stmt-store-result.html . mysqlnd will detect the SQL failure and return false. libmysql will return true. If you want libmysql to change, file a bug report at MySQL... I don't think there is a good way to work around this in the extension itself.

MFH:Fix a problem with cursors, which did not happen with unbuffered PS for some reason. Double free of the data, which led to valgrind warnigns. The fix actually optimizes the code in this cases because the old code used copy_ctor while the new one skips it because it is not needed. Transferring data ownership and nulling works best, for PS where we always copy the string from the result set, unlike the text protocol.

MFH: Fix a bug with mysqlnd_fetch_field(_direct()). With mysqlnd the optimised function was called, which however, doesn't respect that during store the raw data is not unpacked, to be lazy. The data is unpacked to zvals later, during every row fetch. However, this way max_length won't be calculated correctly. So, if a mysqlnd_fetch_field(_direct) call comes we need to unpack everything and then calculate max_length...and that is expensive, defies our lazy unpacking optimisation.

- Added "dechunk" filter which can decode HTTP responces with chunked transfer-encoding. HTTP streams use this filter automatically in case "Transfer-Encoding: chunked" header presents in responce. It's possible to disable this behaviour using "http"=>array("auto_decode"=>0) in stream context - Fixed bug #47021 (SoapClient stumbles over WSDL delivered with "Transfer-Encoding: chunked")

- Fixed bug in ucfirst() implementation. If the tmp_len = 0 then it will not   write the uppercased character to the buffer, but only returns the length of   the uppercased letter as per   http://icu.sourceforge.net/apiref/icu4c/ustring_8h.html#a50. - Updated is_string():   If Unicode semantics is turned on, return "true" for Unicode strings only.   If Unicode semantics is turned off, return "true" for native strings only. - Added is_binary() function that returns "true" for native strings only. - Added first implementation of upgraded strtr function. It works except if   combining sequences or surrogates are used in the non-array method of calling   this function.

Fix: incorrect string length passed
Fixed zend_u_strtod() that returned uninitialized value in case of empty string
- Fixed two memory issues:   - In the first one we were calculating the tmp_len wrong which made the 	u_strFromUTF32() function try to convert too many code points.   - The second issue was a bit more subtle as the "what" string wasn't 	duplicated but still modified. This string is passed as data to the 	function and this kind of data the engine tries to free when the function 	ends. Because we were re-allocating the data the original memory location 	was already freed resulting in a double free error when the engine tries to 	free the argument as it was passed to the function.

To do so the exceptions refcount needs to be increased # before calling zend_clear_exception() to keep the exception alive but # clear the control information. # # As a side note this is alos the easy solution to allow multi exception # handling: Simply clear the engine's exception info and add a property # called $previousException to the base exception and assign it from the # already pending one.

Fix ArrayObject
Fix test
Fix prototype/warning
- Check return-by-reference bit when implementing interface prototypes - Add infrastructure for built-in functions to hint whether they   return by reference or not.  It is NOT currently used for anything,   except for interface prototypes (you can use it to request that the   function that implements your prototype returns by reference or   doesn't return by reference).   For downwards compatibility - by default, interface prototypes are   agnostic as to whether the function that implements them returns   by reference or not.  Use ZEND_BEGIN_ARG_INFO_EX() with   ZEND_RETURN_VALUE/ZEND_RETURN_REFERENCE to change that. - Fix ArrayAccess::getOffset() to conduct additional checks.   If your getOffset() should work with multidimensional arrays - it   must return by reference.
Fix build; line continuation character should be the very last character on a line, otherwise things b0rk.

Fix a bug in the persistent socket liveness checks and feof(); they were using the default socket timeout of 60 seconds before returning the socket to the calling script.  The reason they were using that value is that the same code is used for feof(), so the fix is allowing the caller to indicate the timeout value for liveness checks.

Fix imagegd stdoutput Typo 256 colors
Fix imagegd crashes when used with truecolor image (from jpeg,png, or imagecreatetruecolor) may we add parameters to imagegd to let user specify the palette size and dither (set to 256 and true) ?
Fixed a bug that caused a crash in pdf_open_memory_image(), when a truecolor image was loaded, it now checks if the image is truecolor and performs the appropriate calculations (fixed bug #20785). Changed E_WARNING back to E_ERROR.
Fixed a crash that occurs during the last step of png/jpeg -> gd2 -> png/jpeg conversion. The same crash still occures with png/jpeg -> gd -> png/jpeg, because apparently gd format cannot handle truecolor images. Turned off debug messages inside gd_gd2.c.
Fixed leaks in array_walk()
- Fixed the build with iPlanet LDAP SDK 5.x

Fixing the Win32 compilation of mbstring with mbregex enabled.
Fixing build on WIn32 MBREGEX is disabled for now. 5 mbre_* functions are undefined on WIn32
Fixed flex version check. Some lex scanners like Sun's SGU do not appear to support -V flag, so by passing them data on stdin we prevent them from sitting idle waiting for stdin data. I've also added some common version retrieval flags, that may be supported by various lex scanners.
Fixed a crash bug that can occur due to PDF_delete() being called more then once and E_ERROR occurring during the shutdown sequence.
Fix CGI to match cgi spec. This patch properly fixes support for CGI in PHP.  For backwards compatible broken behaviour, cgi.fix_pathinfo can be set to zero in php.ini. CGI failed to work under apache at all, either using the cgi-script directive or as a ScriptAlias setup. Typicaly it would try to parse itself.  This will still happen if you dissable fix_pathinfo, and set DISCARD_PATH. This also fixes PATH_INFO, and finally we can run pres2 under cgi or fastcgi. This patch has been tested under Apache 1.3, 2.0, IIS, as both cgi and fastcgi, on Windows and OSX.  A followup patch with build stuff for linux will follow.

Fix prototype.
- Fix build (thanks Marcus) - Implement abstract methods, syntax: -    abstract function foo($vars); - I don't see any reason why modifiers such as static/public need to be - used with abstract. PHP is weakly typed and there would be no meaning to - this anyway. People who want a strictly typed compiled language are - looking in the wrong place.
Switched to a new parameter parsing API, which simplifies the code. Made error reporting use php_error_docref(). Fixed a memory leak in shmop_open() when an invalid flag is specified. Added tests for shmop() extension.

remove tests entry. Fix patch entry to contain function name
Fix Win32 build as PHP_CONFIG_FILE_SCAN_DIR is not #defined.
This seems to resolve the issues with fgets. I've moved EOF detection into the streams layer; a stream reader implementation should set stream->eof when it detects EOF. Fixed test for user streams - it still fails but that is due to an output buffering bug.
        Fixed a problem where opendir with <path>/ and having <path>/ in         open_basedir ini option didn't work.  It was removing the trailing         slashes and then addeding it back to only one of the string,         now it adds it back to to both if needed.

Fixed a bug in the new implementation of str_repeat()

- Fix problem when crashing on illegal tokens in class name during class - definition.
Fix warnings
Fixed bug #17825. Double zval_ptr_dtor().
Fixed implicit flush.
Fix infinite recursion bug when using zlib output compression. Cause: the chunk size is taken from the zlib.output_compression setting, which is 0 or 1.  This causes the block_size for output buffer to be set to 0 (1 / 2) and thus causes infinite recursion in php_ob_allocate(). Solution: use a value of 0 for the chunk size which will use the default sizes.  Also add a sanity check which will default the block_size to 1 if it ends up as 0.
- Fix ZE2 build when overload is enabled
Fixed typo. # Thanks to Andrey Hristov.

Separated the #include statements to own file so we don't get any     errors when compiling main/internal_functions.c

- Fix WS and CS a bit
Fix couple of nasty serializer bugs: a) When array unserializer encounters less data than it expects (like: a:1:{}) it crashes. I don't understand exactly why it does, but the fact is it does. So now it should catch "}" and bail out. b) When array/object data are serialized, the count is written by hash count. However, it can be that in-loop check fails and less data than expected will then be written into the array. Which, due to a), would crash on unserialize. So now it will write empty entries in place of entries it cannot serialize (the other choice would be make two passes on the data, which I don't like).
Fix build when openssl is enabled.

Fixed compatibility issues in the ODBC extension for the Velocis Database server.

Makefile.in was changed to use the php_odbc.c file as the source for Velocis support. Other misc changes include a few #defines for some undefined data types and some #ifdefs for unsupported functions.
Fix for PR #9729, 9664, 9656, 8667. All compilers on Solaris should build this extension correctly now. It turns out the SUN CC, by default, enables a define that enables the use of #pragma redefine extname in sun header files. This is why cc would work, and gcc wouldn't.

Fix fclose prototype (#5930)
Heads up!  I have moved the headers_only and response_code checks out of SAPI and down into the individual SAPI modules.  I have made the appropriate changes in all the SAPI modules, but please verify these. The reason for this change is that Apache sometimes will feed PHP a request_method of GET but have r->header_only set to true.  This happens in an ErrorDocument redirect.  In this same scenario we want to preserve the status code as well instead of just overwriting it with a 200 and losing this information.  For now the other sapi modules act exactly as before since they probably do not make this distinction, and they may not even have a valid response code this early in the request. @ Fix HEAD request bug on an Apache ErrorDocument redirect and preserve @ the status code across the redirect as well.  (Rasmus)

Fix up var.c a bit.
Same Fix here
* Fix a buglet in the session module * Make some renames in the session module - avoid having a function called 'delete'   so that we don't piss any C++ compilers.  Also rename the {startup,shutdown}_globals   to {startup,shutdown}_session_globals, so that they're a bit less general names,   and made them static. * Remove uselss variables
Fixing serialize a bit.
Fix
* Fix cases where you assign an array element to the parent array (the array was being erased before the assignment, so the element was being smashed).

- Fixed Karl's bug report.  It's not really a thorough fix, we really need to rethink the INIT_FCALL/DO_FCALL issue. - Fixed numerous AiCount problems
Fix UNIX MySQL build
Fix that GLOBALS leak.  We were explicitly adding GLOBALS to the main symbol table, but there's no reason to do it (INIT_GLOBALS takes care of it if necessary.)
- We weren't counting newlines in heredocs. The only place which is still questionable is when there's a \ followed by a newline but it seems we have a parse error in this case anyways. - Fixed the alloca() macros so that the alloca() #define in win32 mode won't clash with the real win32 alloca().

Fixing a couple of long standing bugs.
I'm on a roll.  Fix a nasty yet stupid AiCount bug
* Add struct name to all typedef's so that they can be debugged with MSVC * Fix an AiCount bug - list(...) = $var was using $var multiple times, and thus causing AiCount to be decreased multiple times even though it was increased only once for $var.  Mark all FETCH_DIM's so that they won't decrease AiCount, and only decrease AiCount on the last FETCH_DIM. * Fix a stupid bug - forgot to pass CLS_C to some compiler function.  For some reason MSVC doesn't report these :I
Fix a memory leak
* Fix error handling startup on the thread-safe CGI version * A failed require() is a compile-time error, consider it as one
* Fix the comments issue.  yymore() worked like a charm. * Change all flex states to be prefixed with ST_
- Fix a small problem with class decelerations.
* Fix all hash checks that checked Bucket.arKey for NULL, when it was changed   to char[1], these checks should have been changed to Bucket.nKeyLength==0 * Support runtime declaration of functions.  I ended up changing the grammar   to catch top level functions vs. nested functions.  The reason is simple -   if we don't have functions properly declared at compile-time, function calls   cannot be resolved at compile time, and have to be resolved at runtime, which   ends up being much much slower (without the optimizer, that is).   It's no biggy though, the grammar change isn't that bad.
Fix a bug
* Include all of the standard modules in internal_functions.c.in.  Stig - is that   the way you intended it to be?  How does the basic_functions module get in there? * Fix to get MySQL objects working, even though I'll probably make a dedicated   MySQL object in the future.
Fixes: * Avoid closing stdin (I could have sworn I've committed that already) * unclean_shutdown patches
Fix
* Fix a bug that occured in case of parse errors.  We need to restore the lexical state even if the compilation failed.
* Move unclean_shutdown from PHP to Zend. * The Master/Local headers in the phpinfo() table were reversed. * Fix a gpc bug
* Make read_post() read input by chunks instead of returning a single string.   This will allow us to efficiently support file upload through SAPI in the future. * Fixes
