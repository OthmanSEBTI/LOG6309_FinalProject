Fixes the backticks in use case signature crash
Fixes SI-4478. - Replaced/simplified usages of "wrt". - Added backticks to $Coll definitions, so stuff like "immutable.Stack"   hopefully stops being interpreted as the end of a sentence and shown   like that in the summary line of ScalaDoc's method description.   See collection.immutable.Stack's sortBy.   Additionally, it looks nicer this way. - Fixes the typo mentioned in SI-5666.
