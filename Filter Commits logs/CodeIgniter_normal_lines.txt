Setting the flag to FALSE is unnecessary since it defaults to FALSE, therefore this block of code can be reduced to a single statement
Set the _key_exists flag to TRUE when the key does in fact exist.  Set it to FALSE if the ID is being regenerated, and set it to TRUE once it's been written.
Add a flag to determine whether the redis key currently exists, and if not, force creation of it at write-time

Cache Driver - Backup Never Loaded The condition that checks to see if the backup driver input is valid was prefixing the input with "cache_".

remove _test_line()
Add test when loading language file and not using the second parameter (language)
Direct return from mimes config, instead of using global $mimes; Global variables are generally a terrible idea, especially for something as simple as this. The mimes.php now returns an array instead of just injecting a variable name into the global namespace.
Loader was too specific about === "", some cases were NULL.

Added support for $_SERVER['CI_ENV'] in index.php Remember this is entirely optional, nothing will change if you do not which to use Multiple Environments just like right now. If you DO set CI_ENV you can manipulate the switch that controls error reporting, etc, so set it to "production" on your live site to hide errors from users. If you don't require this logic you can remove it, or change it entirely to check HTTP_HOST for environment subdomains, or check IP address, etc.

Escaping boolean data type, some DBMS (e.g., postgre) need it

Generate better conditions statement on boolean field type. Actually boolean field type need TRUE or FALSE value. Common DBMS (e.g., MySQL) can substite this value with 1 or 0, but it can't be implemented on PostgreSQL. So, its better to use TRUE or FALSE value for boolean field type.

Bumped CodeIgniter's PHP requirement to 5.2.4. Yes I know PHP 5.4 just came out, and yes I know PHP 5.3 has lovely features, but there are plenty of corporate systems running on CodeIgniter and PHP 5.3 still is not widely supported enough. CodeIgniter is great for distributed applications, and this is the highest we can reasonably go without breaking support. PHP 5.3 will most likely happen in another year or so. Fingers crossed on that one anyway...

It appears the Security class has been added to the system/core folder and is loaded automatically as well.

CodeIgniter ignores the set config value for Maximum Execution Time, overwriting it with its own value of 300 seconds. Whilst this is sensible in the vast majority of situations (browsers), when running a script from CLI, it is likely that execution times may need to be longer. Therefore, don't override the time limit if being run from the CLI - instead default back to PHP's own configuration.

Moved the "is_unique" change log to 2.1.0-dev where it should have been first time. Sorry about that one, had to manually separate 2.0.3 changes from 2.1.0 based mainly on memory.
Removed some error suppression, which would hide a Notice if the path cannot be read. I discovered this by foolishly passing the file_path, not the full_path but took forever for me to realise this as the error returned (thanks to this error suppression) was "GD is not installed" instead of "File cannot be read". Seeing that notice would have made much more sense.

typography tweaks

Continued working on typography class and docs



More tweaks
more tweaks!

Simplified the typography conversion routine... I hope I didn't break something.
Tweaked the auto_typography function
massaged regex for double spaces after sentences

replaced format_characters()' logic replacement with a more straightforward and accurate regex replacement.  The former handled some odd improper punctuation in a more predictable manner, but as a result failed to render many proper punctuation cases correctly.  The new method is a good tradeoff, getting all "correct" punctuation rendered properly with better performance.
Added support for removing javascript event handlers from tags, for security reasons

Moved the "auto typography" class into its own class file in the libraries folder

Did some reorganizing
Allowed empty rules to be set, and fixed a bug that allows blank error messages to output the delimiters.
Removed quick reference from table of contents, as it's from version 1.3.  Much has changed since then.

csv_from_result buggy. revert to old function until rewrite

typo
type cast $key => $val pair in $options array as strings for friendlier handling of setting options as 'selected'
fixed the plural() and singular() function comments
adding type casting of $title argument in URL helper functions to a string.  A numeric 0 sent to these functions would evaluate if ($title == '') as TRUE, and type casting seems the more appropriate fix than simply using $title === '', since we're expecting and treating $title as a string.
bugfix for profiler output: POST keys were not being displayed properly, and queries needed htmlspecialchars()
typo Output vs output
inflector helper changes to account for words ending in "s"
fixed log message typo

typo fix
fixed validation errors... about a zillion of em.
Instead of doing file name security for Enable Query Strings, I am using the already existin _filter_uri()

Modified the include so that there is a bit of filename security

*Added filename_security() method to Input library
*Modified the Router so that when Query Strings are Enabled, the controller trigger and function trigger values are sanitized for filename include security.

Improved XSS clean to not allowing this:


*Updated the XSS Filtering to take into account the IE expression() ability

Modified the is_image() method in the Upload library to take into account Windows IE 6/7 eccentricities when dealing with MIMEs
changed search to use codeigniter.com vs www.codeigniter.com as Google seems to have spidered it much better.
