NancyEngine now implements IDisposable such that when the engine is disposed, it will no longer handle subequent requests and will attempt to cancel existing in-flight requests. Fixes #1864.
fix failing Test LoginFixture.Should_return_unauthorized_without_user_agent() This test did not define not to send a user agent. As the header entry was missing, Nancy.Testing.Browser.CreateRequest() added a default test user agent "Nancy.Testing.Browser" - thus the defining part of the fact to test was missing.

Fixes a small bug in BrowserContext where it was not prepending a "?" for the first item in the query string.

Not to mention, tests that should have worked were failing until the fix was made.

TextResponse Fixture
Fixed file to follow code conventions
Fixed StreamResponse bug with seek position
Fix of a bug where the end of the stream was appended to the data of the multipart. Added closing boundary logic to Multipart. The multipart now stops after the closing buffer instead of the end of the stream. Changed the behavior of browser for multipart. When it adds the closing boundary it also adds \r\n before the boundary like specified in the RFC.

Fixed problem with Windsor bootstrapper returning multiple instances of NancyModules
Fixed typo in readme
Fix for Andreas' .gitignore stopping the new projects building ;-) Added back in the Func<IRouteCache> binding for the Ninject bootstrapper. Worked around the Ninject child container limitation by also registering the modules into the child container when it's constructed. This isn't ideal, as it's extra overhead per-request, and it still can't handle the parent container using "overrides" from the child, but it works, and the latter limitation is something that Ninject users should already be aware of and used to.
