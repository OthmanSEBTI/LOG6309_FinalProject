Merge zend_execute_data->called_scope into zend_execute_data->This. "called_scope" made sense only for static method calls, for dynamic calls it was always equal to the class of $this. Now EG(This) may store IS_OBJECT + $this or IS_UNUSED + "called_scope" (of course, "called_scope" may be NULL). Some code might need to be adopted to support this change. Checks (Z_OBJ(EX(This))) might need to be converted into (Z_TYPE(EX(This)) == IS_OBJECT).

Merge remote-tracking branch 'phpdbg/master' into PHP-5.6
Merge mainstream 'master' branch into refactoring During merge I had to revert: 	Nikita's patch for php_splice() (it probably needs to be applyed again) 	Bob Weinand's patches related to constant expression handling (we need to review them carefully) 	I also reverted all our attempts to support sapi/phpdbg (we didn't test it anyway)
