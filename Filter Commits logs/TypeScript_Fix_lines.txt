Instead of creating filter for subDirectories to watch in the ancestor directory of root, watch those subDirectories for failed lookup locations Before this change, when failed lookup location didnt fall in root directory, we tried to find the ancestor directory of the rootDirectory to watch. We also created subDirectory map for the directories that are being watched so we dont go through invalidation if path is unwanted directory With this change, we will watch those subdirectories instead of root. On windows node supports file system level recursive watching so the earlier approach was better because we reduced number of watches created But on other os, since node doesnt support it, we create the watches for existing folders outselves, so earlier approach becomes expensive. This should be better compromize to satisfy both types of OS. Fixes #24434

Always get diagnostics when emitting irrespective of whether its declaration only emit The diagnostics reporting and expression resolution caching is quite intermingled at present. Hence when we tried to get the declaration output without getting diagnostics, the resolution for functions return expression is cached but errors arent reported Symbols arent marked as referenced. So at later time when trying to get the diagnostics since the expression resolution is cached, it doesnt even go through all checks For now get diagnostics irrespective of declaration only output to avoid this issue.
