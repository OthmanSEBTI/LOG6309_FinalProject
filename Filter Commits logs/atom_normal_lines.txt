Update comment.
Rename a variable to reflect a change in the previous commit.
Two things: * Removed the `Directory` argument to `didSearchPaths`. Now each searcher gets its own instance of `didSearchPaths` that is parameterized by provider. * Simplified `DefaultDirectorySearcher.search()` so it creates one `DirectorySearch` rather than one per `Directory` passed to `search()`.
Comment excised, as recommended by @maxbrunsfeld.
Changed the behavior so that if a searcher rejects, then the thenable returned by `atom.workspace.scan()` rejects.
Changed the contract of `DefaultDirectorySearcher` in two significant ways: * `search()` takes an array of `Directory` objects rather than an individual object. * `options.didSearchPaths` now takes the `Directory` in addition to the `count` as an argument.
Changed DefaultDirectorySearcher to take multiple directories. Still need to update `workspace.coffee` to make better use of this.
Responded to all of @maxbrunsfeld's comments except for: * The effect of a failed search. * Letting `DirectorySearcher::search` take multiple directories.
Document and test the `cancel()` method on the object returned by `atom.workspace.scan()`.
Clean up test to verify that an individual failed search fails the overall search.
remove require for Disposable that is no longer needed
Make delegate method names more delegate-like.
Switch to the delegate pattern, eliminating a nasty race condition and deleting a lot of code.
Remove empty param lists as per the linter.
Two things: 1. Update documentation for `default-directory-search.coffee`. 2. Ensure that multiple `DirectorySearch` searches are run in series rather than in parallel to conserve resources.
Remove `myResolve` local variable that I was using for debugging.
Change DirectorySearcher to return a DirectorySearch.

Regex searches are case-sensitive if any letter is capitalized.
Regex's in the command panel are treated as case-insensitive if there are no non-escaped letters in the pattern
RootView focuses the *first* focusable child.
Buffer.scanInRange can do a case-insensitive search
Second attempt: don't blow up when commenting in files w/ no language bundle
Load local bundles from ~/.atom/bundles
When focused, RootView retains focus itself if it has no focusable children
Optimization: Use absolute positioning instead of flexbox in editor
RootView passes focus to a child element with a tabindex of -1 (if one exists)
RootView (instead of Window) handles opening an empty buffer if no path is given.
Don't explode on `meta-/` if there isn't a valid comment regex
When uncommenting multiple lines, don't raise an error if a line isn't commented

So we don't screw up and press cmd-ctrl-r from the console.
More methods from common.js fs.
yellow was so jarring, wikipedia says this is one of the most calming colors.

Tab tells editor to close file. Tab is then notified about closer.
store project drawer state. this code makes me shudder and will need a massage.

On boot, open up the most recently opened file/dir
Store the last opened path.
Move the index file to the root of the resources dir.
open and save files as utf-8. fixes #23
weird, why isn't `for` a keyword?
since we're being opionated
rely even less on cwd

de-parens
you bastard. how do you not use Cmd-`?
showing invisibles by default.
some files do not have extensions
Got rid of the untitled tab.
I don't think we need this anymore? It works for me with the default timeout of 1.
overflow on the project drawer makes it scroll

This was causing errors. I don't even get how this would work.
@defunkt put that in your ~/.atomicity file, it's erring in my console!
make _.js work in strict mode
require() loads js in strict mode
project drawer twiddles
resource dir is where we want to be

can't read file
addPane takes a Pane. turn project and tab plugins into Panes
move open, openURL, new, reload, & showConsole key commands into Window
panes have keymaps. good or bad?
Turn editor.coffee into an Editor class which subclasses Pane
kill unused document.coffee for now
whitespace and Xcode project cleanup
me too
No longer bootstrap path
Capture key bindings.
missing args default to falsey, so dump them
whoa
kill bootstrap - require.js is the only special case.
osx.coffee is dead.

probably not true
tweak api
switch to `module.exports =` style in tabs.coffee

__filename global - name of the file being require()'d
we only need the setTimeout on the first window load. must be some magic caching going on somewhere.
more coffeescriptish, i think
these only need a tiny bit of timeout
just adding the editor pane statically
it's important to test your code, corey
whitespace
box-flow all the things
Whenever a pane is added or removed, the editorUI is refreshed.
define takes an optional filename. This lets us grab the 'temp' object we set requires to when there are circular references.
added a resize editor method
So that's why my fonts looked off...
commonjs assert module. thanks node!

Display console with cmd-ctrl-k. how do you close the console? You can't yet.
Don't load class.js, it's the craziest code I've ever seen.
panes decide how big they should be.
require() takes a callback
use Array.prototype.some where corey wanted to use _.detect
jazz up the readme

:lipstick:
stylin'
Export bindKey
Moving code to a better place
Don't need it
Got to use the same export object for it to work
__modules contains the full expanded filename. Also, a temporary empty object is set for the files __module so we can have some circular references.
i still love you web console!
Expand paths of /* paths as well.
cwd could change, limit search to plugin folder in bundle.
do not need you anymore
