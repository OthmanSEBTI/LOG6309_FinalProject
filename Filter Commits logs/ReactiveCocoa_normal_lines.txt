Continuous UITextField signals now react to all editing events.
New KVO test case for #3443. The bug was fixed in #3439. It caused the KVO logic to observe the deallocation of object values of non-weak properties, causing various issues including but not limited to deadlocks and unexpected `nil`s.
Test cases for KVO on dependent keys.
Updated a comment in ActionProxy.
Use ObjC association directly for proxy storage.
Resolved a couple of interoperability issues of RAC method swizzling. Two boundary cases were resolved: proxying-then-KVO and interception-then-proxying. A circular invocation bug was also fixed, which would happen on RAC-intercepted, KVO-swizzled selectors when KVO creates its subclass on top of the RAC runtime subclass. Preconditions were also added to trap upon unsupported swizzling combinations.
Revert "Disabled four ActionProxy/DelegateProxy interop test cases."
Capture the superclass instead of relying on `+class`. The class hierarchy up to the subclass returned by `swizzleClass` is immutable. So instead of `+class`, the superclass can be obtained upfront.
Disabled four ActionProxy/DelegateProxy interop test cases.
Refined the DelegateProxy implementation.

added -until: and -waitUntil:
user account now has a URL endpoint too
fixed -combineLastest:, -merge:, -zip:, and -selectMany: to actually act as their Rx counterparts do
a more sensible -canExecute: for RACAsyncCommand
expose the canExecuteBlock and executeBlock properties in a private header
work on tests
work on tests
set the username and password as soon as the button's clicked
whitespace lolz
alright, seriously correct -selectMany:
failing test since it hasn't really been implemented
-selectMany: will take a queryable
chain that shit
corrected -selectMany:… maybe?
return a RACSequence instead of an id
use -bind:toObject:withNegatedKeyPath:
added -bind:toObject:withKeyPath:transform: and -bind:toObject:withNegatedKeyPath:
added a transformer that takes a block
added -subscribeCompleted:
added a logging-in spinner
added test helpers
do the actual GH API call
added -subscribeError:
added an explicit success value to the async function and operation
add a block that returns an operation instead of adding an operation directly
more docs
added support for adding operations to RACAsyncCommands
test that we can't login while we're already logging in
fixed the tests
enabled by default
disable the login button while we're logging in
we create canExecuteValue now
maxConcurrent => maxConcurrentExecutions
don't include enabledness support directly in NSButton
canExecute depends on the operation count and our allowed number of concurrent operations
moved
use primitive types instead of RACValues
added a convenience method for binding with continuous updates
added a define for succinctly getting an observable from a property
don't need a dedicate BOOL for loginEnabled anymore
unit test that shit
reorganizing and exposing things for testing
changed which herders are exposed
-toSequence: and -toObject:keyPath:
added -toObject:keyPath:
-toSequence: now
-toProperty: => -toSequence:
hooked up success and failure labels
-toProperty: returns itself for easy chaining
doh, set the value's value, not the value itself
thanks Xcode?
async function now returns a RACValue instead of a sequence
more work
adding a new demo
more reorganizing
turned ReactiveCocoa into a framework, broke the demo out into its own project
documentation
better implementation of -take:
moved all the queryable implementations into their own category
types
also send completed
only assert if we actually have async functions to perform
check -canExecute: before executing
command can't be nil
renaming
don't need these in the KVO wrapper anymore
lldb I guess
added subscribeNext:completed:error:
send the error callback
added methods for sending next, completed, and error to the observers
added maxConcurrent to RACAsyncCommand
RACOperation is being replaced by RACAsyncCommand
fleshed out RACAsyncCommand
helps if you actually set the values
work on RACAsyncCommand
changes to RACCommand
reworking RACCommand to more closely resemble its RxUI counterpart
share our scheme, I guess
RACOperation example
moved the block to be the last argument
use -bind:toObservable:
added -bind:toObservable:
RACOperation
-take: example
fixed -take:
restore the original suspendNotifications value after we're done adding
added -take:
added -subscribeNext:completed:
return self instead of the observer to allow for chaining
expose -performBlockOnAllObservers: as a private method
use -selectMany:
implemented -selectMany:
added -zip:
remove -selectMany: for now
our added array should always be the same number of items as our observables, so use RACNil if the observable doesn't have a value
added RACNil
property shouldn't be nil
removed the reduce block from -combineLatest: since that can be done with a subsequent -select:
-whenAny: => -combineLatest:, I think that's more in line with Rx's
don't need to declare the return type
_
added a duplicate button
set the initial enabled value
use _ as a placeholder
use -distinctUntilChanged
added -distinctUntilChanged
use execute instead of setting the value directly
added -execute and -canCurrentlyExecute to RACCommand
trying to think through -selectMany:
select the text field's value first
use the custom synthesizers
custom synthesizers for sequences and values to reduce boilerplate
warn that we're about to blow away their target and selector
better variable names
xcode lolz
added +[RACCommand command]
better formatting
added RACCommand
implemented +merge:
added +value
added -observableValueForKeyPath:
more x
use -subscribeNext:
added -subscribeNext: since that's all we're ever doing so far
use x as the standing for brevity
test some shit
expose -lastObject
added specta and expect for testing
better formatting
changed whenAny: to whenAny:reduce:
disclaimer
README
observe and throttle both fields
RACObservableValue instead
better naming
whoops, reverse that
wall werror guys
that can be a class method
cleaning up
create an observable sequence from a property
more fields!
lame whereAny
set the model instead of the UI
refactor array into sequence
better demo
-selectMany:
prune the backing observing array
all the things
first!
