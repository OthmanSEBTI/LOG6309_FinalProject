Based on the feedback on the issue #33914, I  replaced dependent: :destroy with touch: :books_updated_at which will make the example consistent with the example that already exists on that page.  * Also Removing the touch option from the belong_to scopes example as the option doesnt have any relation to association scope.

Fix several known web encoding issues:
Fixed that an ArgumentError is thrown when request.session_options[:id] is read in the following scenario: when the cookie store is used, and the session contains a serialized object of an unloaded class, and no session data accesses have occurred yet.

Added some test coverage for this case and others related to deserialization of unloaded types.

Fixed that SQLite3 exceptions are caught and reported properly #823 [yerejm]
Fixed :anchor use in url_for #821 [Nicholas Seckar]
Fixed example in docs
Fixed that symbols can be used on attribute assignment, like page.emails.create(:subject => data.subject, :body => data.body)
Fixed textilize to be resilient to getting nil parsed (by using Object#blank? instead of String#empty?)
Fixed that the :multipart option in FormTagHelper#form_tag would be ignored [Yonatan Feldman]
Fixed tests for indifferent access
Fixed Hash#indifferent_access to also deal with include? and fetch and nested hashes #726 [Nicholas Seckar]

Added transactional fixtures that uses rollback to undo changes to fixtures instead of DELETE/INSERT -- it's much faster. See documentation under Fixtures #760 [bitsweat]
Fixed WEBrick server to use ABSOLUTE_RAILS_ROOT instead of working_directory #687 [Nicholas Seckar]
Fixed rails_generator to be usable without RubyGems #686 [Cristi BALAN]. Moved all active support dependencies into active support
Fixed that single quote was not escaped in a UrlHelper#link_to javascript confirm #549 [Scott Barron]
Fixed reflection_for_gps_location test
Fixed that HasManyAssociation#count was using :finder_sql rather than :counter_sql if it was available #445 [Scott Barron]
Fixed that form helpers would treat string and symbol keys differently in html_options (and possibly create duplicate entries) #112 [bitsweat]
Fixed -h/--help for generate and destroy generators #331
Fixed that broken pipe errors (clients disconnecting in mid-request) could bring down a fcgi process
Fixed an exception when using Ajax based requests from Safari because Safari appends a \000 to the post body. Symbols can't have \000 in them so indifferent access would throw an exception in the constructor. Indifferent hashes now use strings internally instead. #746 [Tobias Luetke]
Fixed that RAILS_ROOT might not be defined when AP was loaded, so do a late initialization of the ROUTE_FILE #761 [Scott Barron]
Fix request.path_info and clear up LoadingModule behavior #754 [Nicholas Seckar]
Fixed caching to be aware of extensions (so you can cache files like api.wsdl or logo.png) #734 [Nicholas Seckar]

Fixed test/mocks/testing to the correct test/mocks/test #740
Fixed the missing shebang in main "rails" script #736
Fixed that Routes would raise NameErrors if a controller component contains characters that are not valid constant names #733 [Nicholas Seckar]

Fixed some tests
Fixed component method names
Fixed the Broken pipe error on SHOW FIELDs queries too
Fix the error message on generate mailer
Fixed path problem
Fixed that when using validation macros with a custom message, if you happened to use single quotes in the message string you would get a parsing error #657 [tonka]

Fixed the SQL Server adapter on a bunch of issues #667 [DeLynn]
Fixed textilize for RedCloth3 to keep doing hardbreaks
Fixed that the dynamic finder like find_all_by_something_boolean(false) didn't work #649 [lmarlow@yahoo.com]
Fixed that assert_template_xpath_matches did not indicate when a path was not found #658 [Eric Hodel]
Fixed a bit to eager requiring of oracle bindings in oracle adapter #634
Fixed functional test path problems #662
Fixed that on validation errors, scaffold couldn't find template #654 [mindel]
Fixed that a bunch of methods from ActionController::Base was accessible as actions (callable through a URL) when they shouldn't have been #644 [Nicholas Seckar].  Base#hide_actions(*names) to hide public methods from a controller that would otherwise have been callable through the URL. For the majority of cases, its preferred just to make the methods you don't want to expose protected or private (so they'll automatically be hidden) -- but if you must have a public method, this is a way to make it uncallable. Base#hidden_actions retrieve the list of all hidden actions for the controller #644 [Nicholas Seckar]
Fix that routes werent being loaded in production environment
Fixed the verbosity of using the AR store
Fixed https handling on other ports than 443 [Alan Gano]
Fixed generated functional test for nested controllers has wrong paths #635
Fixed all the tests
Fix deprecated id error #588
Fix test case for MySQL #598
Fixed Inflector for words like "news" and "series" that are the same in plural and singular #603 [echion], #615 [marcenuc]
Fixed whitespace
Fixed double requiring of models with the same name as the controller
Fixed that query params could be forced to nil on a POST due to the raw post fix #562 [moriq@moriq.com]
Fixed documentation snafus #575, #576, #577, #585
Fixed that cookies shouldn't be frozen in TestRequest #571 [Eric Hodel]
Fixed Base#clone for use with PostgreSQL #565 [hanson@surgery.wisc.edu]
Fixed dependency reloading by switching to a remove_const approach where all Active Records, Active Record Observers, and Action Controllers are reloading by undefining their classes. This enables you to remove methods in all three types and see the change reflected immediately and it fixes #539. This also means that only those three types of classes will benefit from the const_missing and reloading approach. If you want other classes (like some in lib/) to reload, you must use require_dependency to do it.
Fixed the ordering of attributes in the xml-decleration of Builder #540 [woeye]
Fixed documentation #538
Fixed that /Recipe/new and /recipe/new points to the same thing [Lyle Johnson]
Fixed skeleton Rakefile to work with sqlite3 out of the box #521 [rasputnik]
Fixed that the dynamic finders didnt treat nil as a "IS NULL" but rather "= NULL" case #515 [Demetrius]
Fixed install.rb files
Fixed that script/breakpointer didn't get the Ruby path rewritten as the other scripts #523 [brandt@kurowski.net]
Fixed that records fetched with piggy-back attributes or through rich has_and_belongs_to_many associations couldn't be saved due to the extra attributes not part of the table #522 [Eric Anderson]
Fixed handling of syntax errors in models that had already been succesfully required once in the current interpreter. Fixed superclass mismatch and other controller related problems by not using dependency reloading for controllers.
Fixed that association proxies would fail === tests like PremiumSubscription === @account.subscription

Fixed that generate scaffold would produce bad functional tests
Fixed no-binding fragment caching
Fixed that FCGI can also display SyntaxErrors
Fixed that column aliases didn't work as expected with the new MySql411 driver #507 [Demetrius]
Fixed that find_all would produce invalid sql when called sequentialy #490 [Scott Baron]
Fixed that all redirect and render calls now return true, so you can use the pattern of "do and return". Added that renders and redirects called in before_filters will have the same effect as returning false: stopping the chain. Added that only one render or redirect can happen per action. The first call wins and subsequent calls are ignored.
Fixed that a default fragment store wan't being set to MemoryStore as intended
Fixed that the belongs_to and has_one proxy would fail a test like 'if project.manager' -- this unfortunately also means that you can't call methods like project.manager.build unless there already is a manager on the project #492 [Tim Bates]
Fixed that the Ruby/MySQL adapter wouldn't connect if the password was empty #503 [Pelle]
Fixed a bug where cookies wouldn't be set if a symbol was used instead of a string as the key
Fixed bug in page caching that prevented it from working at all
Fixed sending of emails to use Tmail#from not the deprecated Tmail#from_address

Fixed that unit tests for MySQL are now run as the "rails" user instead of root #455 [Eric Hodel]
Added support for associating unsaved objects #402 [Tim Bates] Added replace to associations, so you can do project.manager.replace(new_manager) or project.milestones.replace(new_milestones) #402 [Tim Bates] Added build and create methods to has_one and belongs_to associations, so you can now do project.manager.build(attributes) #402 [Tim Bates] Fixed that Base#== wouldn't work for multiple references to the same unsaved object #402 [Tim Bates] Added that if a before_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks and the associated action are cancelled. If an after_* callback returns false, all the later callbacks are cancelled. Callbacks are generally run in the order they are defined, with the exception of callbacks defined as methods on the model, which are called last. #402 [Tim Bates]
Fixed log file permissions to be 666 instead of 777 (so they're not executable) #471 [Lucas Carlson]
Fixed binary support for PostgreSQL #444 [alex@byzantine.no]
Fixed that auto reloading would some times not work or would reload the models twice #475 [Tobias Luetke]
Fixed page caching problems with saving cached file fails for the index action and that it shouldnt cache files with GET/POST parameters #462
Fixed that controller tests can now assert on the use of cookies #466 [Alexey]
Fixed that send_file would "remember" all the files sent by adding to the headers again and again #458 [bitsweat]
Fixed that bcc and cc should be settable through @bcc and @cc -- not just @headers["Bcc"] and @headers["Cc"] #453 [Eric Hodel]. Fixed Action Mailer to be "warnings safe" so you can run with ruby -w and not get framework warnings #453 [Eric Hodel]
Fixed url rewriter confusion when the controller or action name was a substring of the controller_prefix or action_prefix
Fixed url rewriter confusion when the controller name was a substring of the controller_prefix
Fixed the half applied 393 changeset
Fixed the 4.11 changes to the mysql adapter
Fixed that MemCacheStore wasn't included by default and added default MemCache object pointing to localhost #447 [Lucas Carlson]

Fixed that host would choke when cgi.host returned nil #432 [Tobias Luetke]
Fixed default scope of acts_as_list from "1" to "1 = 1", so itll work in PostgreSQL (among other places) #427 [Alexey]
Fixed that Dependencies.reload can't load the same file twice #420 [Kent Sibilev]
Fixed script/console to work with Windows (that requires the use of irb.bat) #418 [octopod]
Fixed random ordering of test cases that would cause errors on some systems #446 [Josh]
Added Fixnum#ago/until, Fixnum#since/from_now #450 [bitsweat]
Fixed three issues with retrying breakpoints #417 [Florian Gross]
Added time unit extensions to Fixnum that'll return the period in seconds, like 2.days + 4.hours
Fixed rewriting of dashes, lashes
Fixed that conditions in has_many and has_and_belongs_to_many should be interpolated just like the finder_sql is
Fixed WEBrick servlet slowdown over time by restricting the load path reloading to mod_ruby #372
Fixed Base#update_attribute to be indifferent to whether a string or symbol is used to describe the name
Fixed small issue with ARGV and IRB
Fixed some thread safety issues with DB2
Fixed #406 for real
Fixed that validates_uniqueness_of used 'id' instead of defined primary key #406
Fixed that the overwritten respond_to? method didn't take two parameters like the original #391
Fixed that the overwritten respond_to? method didn't take two parameters like the original #391
Fixed the last details to please DB2
Fixed a YAML fixture on time coming out as an integer #415 [Dan Peterson]
Fixed redirects when the controller and action is named the same. Still haven't fixed same controller, module, and action, though #201 [Josh]
Fixed loading problems with controller hierarchies
Fixed problems with running multiple functional tests in Rails under 1.8.2 by including hack for test/unit weirdness
Fixed problems with dependency caching and controller hierarchies on Ruby 1.8.2 in development mode #351
Fixed handling of binary content in blobs and similar fields for Ruby/MySQL and SQLite #409 [xal]
Fixed a bug in the Ruby/MySQL that caused binary content to be escaped badly and come back mangled #405 [Tobias Luetke]
Fixed some test cases
Fixed that @request.remote_ip didn't work in the test environment #369 [Bruno Mattarollo]
Fixed quoting in validates_format_of that would allow some rules to pass regardless of input #390 [Dmitry V. Sabanin]
Fixed that generated action_mailers doesnt need to require the action_mailer since thats already done in the environment #382 [Lucas Carlson]
Fixed broken transactions that were actually only running object-level and not db level transactions [andreas]
Fixed dependency management to happen in a unified fashion for Active Record and Action Pack using the new Dependencies module. This means that the environment options needs to change.
Fixed that the const_missing autoload assumes the requested constant is set by require_association and calls const_get to retrieve it. If require_association did not set the constant then const_get will call const_missing, resulting in an infinite loop #380 [bitsweat]
Fixed UrlHelper#link_to_unless so it doesn't care if the id is a string or fixnum [zenspider]
Fixed mixin test and fixtures to work with postgresql #353 [Scott Baron]
Fixed that options[:counter_sql] was overwritten with interpolated sql rather than original sql #355 [bitsweat]
Fixed that overriding an attribute's accessor would be disregarded by add_on_empty and add_on_boundary_breaking because they simply used the attributes[] hash instead of checking for @base.respond_to?(attr.to_s). [Marten]
Fixed CTRL-C exists from the Breakpointer to be a clean affair without error dumping [Kent Sibilev]
Fixed "rake stats" to work with sub-directories in models and controllers and to report the code to test ration [Scott Baron]
Fixed that Base.table_name would expect a parameter when used in has_and_belongs_to_many joins [Anna Lissa Cruz]
Fixed that nested transactions now work by letting the outer most transaction have the responsibilty of starting and rolling back the transaction. If any of the inner transactions swallow the exception raised, though, the transaction will not be rolled back. So always let the transaction bubble up even when you've dealt with local issues. Closes #231 and #340.
Fixed validates_{confirmation,acceptance}_of to only happen when the virtual attributes are not nil #348 [dpiddy@gmail.com]
Fixed regression with Base#reset_session that wouldn't use the the DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS [adam@the-kramers.net]
Fixed error rendering of rxml documents to not just swallow the exception and return 0 (still not guessing the right line, but hey)
Fixed small doc bug [dblack]
Fixed that textilize and markdown would instantiate their engines even on empty strings. This also fixes #333 [Ulysses]
Fixed the automated timestamping feature when running under Rails' development environment that resets the inheritable attributes on each request.
Fixed a bug that would cause an ApplicationController to require itself three times and hence cause filters to be run three times [evl]
Fixed a small bug in the new referencing of DEFAULT_SESSION_OPTIONS
Fixed DateHelper#date_select so that you can pass include_blank as an option even if you don't use start_year and end_year #59 [what-a-day]
Fixed that Base#find will return an array if given an array -- regardless of the number of elements #270 [Marten]
Fixed that has_and_belongs_to_many would generate bad sql when naming conventions differed from using vanilla "id" everywhere [RedTerror]
Fixed bug with reloading associations
Fixed that every successive call on the sqlite adapter prepended RAILS_ROOT again and again because RAILS_ROOT itself is the Windows absolute path which begins with the drive letter #294
Fixed a pattern for module loading
Fixed the default button name on forms generated with form
Fixed CgiRequest so that it'll now accept session options with Symbols as keys (as the documentation points out) [Suggested by Andreas]
Fixed CgiRequest#out to fall back to #write if  doesn't have #syswrite [bitsweat]
Fixed all helpers so that they use XHTML compliant double quotes for values instead of single quotes [htonl/bitsweat]
Fix breakpointing by differenciating between gem and not
Fixed problem with cookies not being set to path=/ by default and a test buggerboo
Fixed a few issues for the breakpointing
Tidied up Fixtures for better readability and some error checking [bitsweat]
Fixed TIMESTAMP columns broken due to TIME handling patch
Fixed Base.errors to be indifferent as to whether strings or symbols are used.
Fixed to_input_field_tag so it no longer explicitly uses InstanceTag.value if value was specified in the options hash [evl]
Fixed value quoting in all generated SQL statements, so that integers are not surrounded in quotes and that all sanitation are happening through the database's own quoting routine. This should hopefully make it lots easier for new adapters that doesn't accept '1' for integer columns.
Fixed has_and_belongs_to_many guessing of foreign key so that keys are generated correctly for models like SomeVerySpecialClient [Florian Weber]
Fixed that methods wrapped in callbacks still return their original result #260 [bitsweat]
Fixed a bug with the HEAD stuff
Fixed the Inflector to handle the movie/movies pair correctly #261 [Scott Baron]
Fixed fixtures using primary key fields called something else than "id" #270 [dave]
Fixed that cached template loading would still check the file system to see if the file existed #258 [Andreas Schwarz]
Fixed infinite loop when environment is missing in database.yml
Fixed bad chars in public/.htaccess [imajes]
Fixed AbstractRequest#remote_ip for users going through proxies - Patch #228 [Eric Hodel]
