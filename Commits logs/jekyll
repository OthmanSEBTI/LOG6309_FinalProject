Give name of file that generated YAML exception message
Merge git://github.com/mojombo/jekyll
Now creates _<directory> for each post type (e.g. _posts, _pages, _attachments)
Drafts are now marked as published:false
Sometimes wp:post_name can be empty (e.g. when a post is still draft), in this case we make up an appropriate permalink_title that will be used as the filename. The importer can always rename the file later on, and at least the file is unlikely to have been overwritten by another draft on the same day.
Added meta tag import goodness. This for instance allows you to preserve all your hard-worked on WP SEO keywords, images, alternative images and other yummy-ness. Replaced PubDate with wp:post_date, this is better than PubDate since some of the posts you import could be a draft (in this case the pubDate is invalid and contains a non-sensical value). Added wp:status so we now know whether the post is published, draft or in the trash. Added wp:post_type so we differentiate between posts and image or other post types
