Factor out implementation of fromIterable of mutable collections.

Merge pull request #73 from scala/hierarchy
Pull up mapInPlace to mutable.Iterable, so that it is consistently inherited by all mutable collections. Pull up flatMapInPlace and filterInPlace to mutable.GrowableIterable, which is a new trait extending both Iterable and Growable. Make mutable.Map extend GrowableIterable (and implement its newly inherited methods). Make GrowableSeq extend GrowableIterable (and remove inherited method definitions). Make mutable.Set extend GrowableIterable (and adapt its previous mapInPlace methods to match exactly their new signature).
Factor out the subtract method in a Shrinkable trait. Move method implementations in XxxOps traits.
Tune hierarchy of mutable collections - mutable.Map is a mutable.Iterable. - mutable.Set is a mutable.Iterable.

Display raw type as existential in error message Before, when implementing a raw type in a method override in the wrong way, the error message always suggested a simple wildcard type. This commit changes that error message to always suggest an existential type that the user can copy paste into his code. To that end `typeParamsToExistentials` is changed to preserve the names of the type parameters instead of changing them to "?0".."?N".

Force several tests to run using inline delambdafication. The differences when running with method based delambdafication aren't important enough yet to create specialized versions that use method based delambdafication.
Create test variants where delambdafication alters signatures. This commit includes several tests where there's a variation in signatures between inline delambdafication and method based delambdafication.
De-duplicate logic in maven deployment.
Enforce consistency of pack, docs, osgi, maven tasks.
Make specialization aware of anonymous functions. During development of late delmabdafying there was a problem where specialization would undo some of the work done in uncurry if the body of the lambda had a constant type. That would result in a compiler crash as when the delambdafy phase got a tree shape it didn't understand. This commit has a fix and a test.
Make GenASM not eliminate loadmodule on static methods. During development of delayed delambdafy there was a problem where GenASM would eliminate a loadmodule for all methods defined within that module even if those methods were static. The result would be broken byte code that failed verification. This commit fixes that and adds a test.
Flesh out the Delambdafy phase.
Refactor Erasure for delambdafication. This commit is purely a refactor. It pulls code needed to adapt a tree of one type into a tree of another type (by casting, boxing, coercing, etc) out of Erasure and into common locations that will be usable from the Delambdafy phase.
Adds a setting to delay delambdafication. If set then uncurry lifts the body of a lambda into a local def. Tests are included to show the different tree shapes.

Add a skeletal Delambdafy phase. This commit adds a do-nothing phase called "Delambdafy" that will eventually be responsible for doing the final translation of lambdas into classes.
Make future-spec tests not spawn threads in constructors. The future-spec tests were spawning threads in object constructors which meant they were on the ragged edge of entering deadlock from the static initialization lock acquired during the static initialization blocks we use to construct object reference fields. My work on restructuring lambdas pushed it over the edge. This commit refactors the tests to use class constructors rather than object constructors.

SI-6370 changed ListMap apply0 method to produce correct error message when a key is not found Current implementation of apply0 relies on tail method to iterate over all keys. When the list gets to its end, tail produces an 'empty map' message in its exception, which is thrown by ListMap. This change checks if the collection is empty before calling tail and provides a more appropriate key not found message.

Don't populate the concreteSpecMethod set in presentation compiler runs. This is safe because the presentation compiler never runs the tree transformer (where this map is needed). This is a source of serious memory leaks in the IDE, but it wasn't visible before because the IDE didn't run the info transformers far enough. Interestingly, this is not a leak in batch runs: each element of the set is removed when the tree is transformed.

Miscellaneous fixes to reification
Incorporate Ctrie into standard library.
Fix sbt build with trunk. This was tricky to find as HLists and multiple chains of implicits are definitely not fun to debug. Reporting ambiguous errors is influenced by the general error reporting, don't look for implicit arguments if any of the preceding ones failed (kills performance, causes diverging implicits with HLists). Previously throwing type errors handled that correctly but now we don't do that. Fixed small but essential typo when typing implicit. Review by @dragos

Cleanup and better documentation of reflect.api.Symbols trait

Scalac fork no longer dumps stacktraces on compilation errors
Use context for buffering errors that cannot/shouldn't be reported in the given moment (instead of throwing type errors).

Moved type parameter A from RedBlack to Tree.
Moved from Empty case object to case class in preparation of moving type parameter A.
Moved from implicit ordering value to implicit parameter.
Switched from isSmaller to ordering.
Implemented takeWhile/dropWhile/span to use tree splitting. This changes the operation from O(n log n) to O(n) and allows for more structural sharing.
Implemented drop/take/slice/splitAt/dropRight/takeRight for TreeMap/TreeSet by splitting the underlying RedBlack tree. This makes the operation O(log n) instead of O(n) and allows more structural sharing.
RedBlack.scala: Change count from 'def' to 'val' in NonEmpty tree to ensure TreeSet/TreeMap 'range' operations are O(log n) instead of O(n).
Optimized implementation of init/tail for TreeSet/TreeMap.
Optimized implementations of head/headOption/last/lastOption for TreeMap/TreeSet.
Use custom implementation for iterating over RedBlack trees. Raw performance is much better than '++' based iterator.
Use RedBlack.iterator to create iterators for TreeSet/TreeMap. This turns iterator creation from an O(n) operation into an O(log n) operation. Unfortunately, it halves actual iteration speed (consuming the iterator fully), probably due to the many by-name closures that are needed.
Tone down insensible-equality warning.
