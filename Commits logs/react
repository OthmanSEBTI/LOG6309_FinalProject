Fix bugs that occur when event responder unmounts during a touch event sequence > This PR adds a test (initially failing) for this case along with a fix for stack and fiber. The stack fix was copied from a Diff submitted by @sema. The fiber fix just required us to stop leaking properties for unmounted views. > Longer term we may want to explicitly invoke a release event listener for a responder just before unmounting it. This PR does not do that.

Jest preprocessor better aware of error-codes/codes.json WRT caching
Removed exact object type for StackCursor Flow type This was causing the 'react:extract-errors' Gulp taks to fail.
ReactFiberStack cursor values are no longer corrupted on pop
Avoid reading the same StackCursor current multiple times
Avoid popping hosts that do not provide unique contexts
Tightened up Fiber | null type in ReactFiberStack to always require Fiber
Combined unwindContext and unwindHostContext into unwindContexts
Generic type added to StackCursor. Default emptyObject replaced with null.
Added ReactFiberStack shared by ReactFiberContext and ReactFiberHostContext ReactFiberStack is the new underlying stack used by ReactFiberContext and ReactFiberHostContext. The goal is to simplify the 2 context managers and to add more errors/dev-warnings when we pop unexpected. This changeset currently causes a lot of tests to fail (as we are currently popping too many times and/or in the wrong order). I'm pushing this branch now to share with Sebastian as he is working on a related cleanup pass at beginWork.

Merge pull request #2570 from yungsters/updates
Summary: Currently, `ReactUpdates` updates dirty components in increasing order of mount depth. However, mount depth is only relative to the component passed into `React.render`. This breaks down for components that invoke `React.render` as an implementation detail because the child components will be updated before the parent component.
