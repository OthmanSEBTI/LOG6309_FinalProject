Joe's feedback
make hide and remove work well when we want to hide/remove a tab inside a navbarMenu (or the whole menu) and it is selected (before this commit, it wasn't navigating to the first tab like it is supposed to)
make this PR work for modules
added select argument to showTab function
for dynamic tabs, send message on `session$onFlush` (instead of `session$onFlushed`)
Abandon nearest neighbor tab-showing logic. Just grab the first tab.

a more fundamental fix of the Unicode issue
Add placeholder parameter to textInput
after reading a file as UTF-8, try to convert it to native encoding on Windows only if the conversion is not lossy
the check is.na(iconv(x, 'UTF-8')) does not really make sense
don't declare encoding on the anonymouse file connection
textConnection() can be lossy; use an anonymous file connection instead to preserve UTF-8 characters
make sure writeLines() does not convert text to native encoding
make sure the UI HTML is rendered into a connection with UTF-8 encoding
convert the result of readLines() to UTF-8 using enc2utf8() instead, since enc2native() can be lossy
fixes #961: the JSON string from jsonlite::toJSON() is always encoded in UTF-8, so there is no need to re-encode it
shiny requires R >= 3.0.0

R CMD check will warn against the possibly missing variables `inline` and `type`
rename newOptions to config
inherit doc for updateFooInput() from fooInput()
when we need <optgroup> for the child elements of `choices`, we just generate it no matter what the child element is
when choice is not a list, we need to return its first element
make updateSelectInput(), updateCheckboxGroupInput(), and updateRadioButtons() work
factor out the code to generate options from checkboxGrouptInput() and radioButtons(), and use the new generator generateOptions() for them
validateSelected() does not validate `selected` for the optgroup case; this function is only for shiny <= 0.9
choicesWithNames() should also consider the optgroup case now: all optgroup nodes must be named
closes #326: generate <optgroup> when `choices` is a named list of choices
recursively select the first choice, to make sure `selected` is a scalar, even when `choices` is a list of lists (optgroup)

subdir=NULL is the default of runUrl()
the message is not very useful, given that download() will emit a message
closes #427: runGitHub() can accept "username/repo" in its first argument

yes, it is weird to select by names instead of values; now the weirdness has gone
news for #340
update JS tests accordingly
roxygenize
`selected` refers to values instead of labels/names of `choices`
per suggestion of @wch, we do not pass the selected/checked status in the message; the selected values are in message$value, and they will be set via this.setValue(el, data.value) in receiveMessage() in shiny.js
fixes #176: the problem of choices=NULL also affects selectInput()
pass the selected value(s) to checkbox/radio group
only do mapply() when length(choices) > 0, otherwise options = list(), and this will lead to an empty checkbox/radio group
it is not possible to do names(NULL) <- value, so return early when choices is NULL
for select input, setValue() with a nonexistent value turns its value to null
