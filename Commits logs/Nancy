Browser: remove sync methods, remove 'Async' postfix.
LegacyBrowser. Sync methods only, wraps Browser.
What is [obsolete(.., false)]? call site gets warning.
Test fix, exception is expected
All these test methods need to be async
Using .GetAwaiter().GetResult() so any exceptions are not wrapped in an aggregate exception.
Missing //Then
Should be awaited
Stupid stray new ling

Add 'Async' postfix to all Browser methods.
Reverting to using Invoke()
Fix test (broken from rebase)
Sprinkle ConfigureAwait(false) where needed (Nancy, Nancy.Testing, Nancy.Owin, Nancy.Hosting.Self, Nancy.Hosting.AspNet)

These tests aren't needed. The AfterPipeline enumerator is awaited so there is never a null task returned.
Don't need the .Invoke here
Don't need these tests. async await unwraps exceptions for us
CompletedTask doesn't need to be laziy initialized.

Nancy Browser is now async and updated all Nancy.Testing.Tests to be async where necessary.
Actually these references are needed.
Unused references

Fix test - explicitly set the NancyBootstrapperLocator.Bootstrapper
Do NOT use static service location in NancyMiddleware. The will cause all sort of problems if there is more than one Nancy instance / bootstrapper in a owin pipeline. (reverted from commit e8ae7c4a92ffcb92c47744f2d921978c2b03fd45)
Do NOT use static service location in NancyMiddleware. The will cause all sort of problems if there is more than one Nancy instance / bootstrapper in a owin pipeline.
Katana user and owin user flow through.
Because Nancy middleware is in own project, move middlware tests to Nancy.Tests
Perhaps TargetFrameworkVersion should be 4.5?
Removing Nancy.Authentication.Token and all related projects. Token (Bearer) auth should be implemented by suitable middleware.
Delete tests /requiresvalidatedclaims isn't a thing.
Nancy.Demo.Authentication.Stateless fixed to use ClaimsPrincipal.
Fix Nancy.Damo.Authentication.Forms to support ClaimsPrincipal
Nancy.Demo.Authentication fixed to use ClaimsPrincipal
Nancy.Demo.Authentication.Basic fixed to use ClaimsPrincipal
Removing RequiresValidatedClaims - doesn't make sense give we're using predicate in RequriesClaims
Nancy.Tests.Function fixed to use ClaimsPrincipal.
Unused using
Replace IUserIdentity with ClaimsPrincipal.
Fix, changes (and some deletions) to ModuleSecurity, SecurityHooks and related tests due to ClaimsPrincipal support.
Authentication.Stateless user lookup func returns a ClaimsPrincipal
Froms Auth IUserMapper returns a ClaimsPrincipal
Basic Auth IUserValidator returns a ClaimsPrincipal.
ModuleSecurity and SecurityHooks fixed to use ClaimsPrincipal extensions.
Rename UserIdentityExtensions to ClaimsPrincipalExtension. Mapped IUserIdentity extension methods to ClaimsPrincipal.
Deleting IUserIdentity. This breaks all the things.

comments in test DynamicDictionaryFixture.cs Should_remove_natural_key
Found a key bug in DynamicDictionary.cs Remove(string key) Added test that confirms fix. DynamicDictionaryFixture.cs  Should_remove_natural_key()
Inconsistent behavior between indexer and add methods in DynamicDictionary.cs indexers uses GetNaturalKey, while Add does not. Added natural key behavior to Add overloads. All tests pass. Not sure if this is the desired behavior but seems odd if d.Add("a-b-c","hello") means something else than d["a-b-c"] = "hello" for an empty dictionary...

Fix for unexpected request stream switching
Implementing fix to issue where Nancy can't find embedded resource views in other assemblies when adding them as RootNamespaces to ResourceViewLocationProvider. I rediscovered this issue but the original fix was found and suggested by Rex Witten here: http://tinyurl.com/l2n6u2g ; his fix resolves my issues of views embedded as resources in satellite assemblies not being loaded by the ResourceViewLocationProvider as expected by Nancy.

Passing NancyContext to IModelValidator.Validate
Added class Json/JavaScriptPrimitiveConverter.cs as an abstract base class along the same lines as JavaScriptSerializer.cs, but where the serialized value is simply an 'object' and not an 'IDictionary<string, object>'. Updated Json/JsonSettings.cs to store a list of JavaScriptPrimitiveConverter objects in a list exposed by new property PrimitiveConverters. Added a field _primitiveConverterList to Json/JavaScriptSerializer.cs to store a list of enumerable sequences of primitive converters, along the same lines as _converterList, added accessor method GetPrimitiveConverter following the same pattern as GetConverter, and added RegisterConverters overloads that accept sequences of JavaScriptPrimitiveConverter implementations and registers them. Updated the JavaScriptSerializer constructor that accepts a parameter "registerConverters" to actually pay attention to it. Updated the ConvertToType method in Json/JavaScriptSerializer.cs to check for a primitive converter before doing any other analysis Updated SerializeValueImpl in Json/JsonSerializer.cs to check for a JavaScriptPrimitiveConverter in the owner JavaScriptSerializer object after all other serialization, but before emitting the value. (This places it in the same point in the pipeline as in deserialization.) Updated Responses/DefaultJsonSerializer.cs and ModelBinding/DefaultBodyDeserializers/JsonBodyDeserializer.cs to register primitive converters in addition to regular converters when initializing the JavaScriptSerializer that will be used to serialize or deserialize request/response data.

If the host header is not supplied (as can be the case for http/1.0), default to Dns.GetHostName()
Check if task has faulted in mock route action
Continue enumeration if the task isn't faulted.  Prevents accessing current.Result from throwing.

Fix tests in AfterPipelineFixture.  When adding piplines, instead of asserting on the items added, assert using the collection items.

Fixes a small bug in BrowserContext where it was not prepending a "?" for the first item in the query string.

Not to mention, tests that should have worked were failing until the fix was made.

Makes DynamicDrop respect the global case comparison setting when building a dictionary from an ExpandoObject.
One more change to DynamicDrop - this time to return null instead of error messages to better match liquid template conventions. If error strings are returned, then the templates don't behave consistently or as expected in many cases (for example, "{{nonexistant.foo.bar}}" returns an empty string but "{{model.nonexistant}}" returns an error string - also, "{% if model.foo %}" will always return true, whether the model has a foo or not because of the error string).

Adds ViewBag support to the DotLiquid view engine.
Added missing extension

response.WithStatusCode(int) extension method

Rolling back some unneeded cosmetic changes prior to submitting a pull request.
Removing a mistaken gitignore file.
Modifies the LiquidNancyFileSystem to search for included templates using established location conventions rather than simply looking at the absolute path. Also modifies the ViewEngineStartupContext to provide a property for the view engine extensions since it was there but not accessible (view engines like DotLiquid can use this for template name resolution).
Passes the DotLiquidViewEngine to the IFileSystemFactory and on down to the LiquidNancyFileSystem so that the extension(s) set in the view engine can be used (and changed in one place) instead of hard coding the "liquid" extension. Uses higher performance string comparison operations instead of a regular expression for dropping extensions.

Minor refactoring
Add unit tests for changes to default binder.  Make sure it is possible to bind models from the query and the context parameters.  Make sure the the order of precedence is met.  Make sure parameters from different sources can be used to bind a single object.
Also look at the context parameters.  Add a null check on each dictionary in the list.  Refactor to (hopefully) make code more readable
Also use the request data for the default binder.  If data in the form and the request have the same parameter names, the value in the form is used and the request value is ignored.

Sorted out a couple of merge issues
Updated readme file
Integrated bug fixes by James Eggers and Steven Robbins
Added parameter tests and fixed up DynamicDictionary
Small fix to attempt to solve blow-ups when scanning the app domain inside Visual Studio (grr!) Updated TinyIoC to the latest version. Should probably write a helper/extension for GetAppDomainTypesFortype() as we do app domain scanning in more than one place. This fix will do for now though because I need to finish my coffee :-)
Additional check on module discovery
Added Unity bootstrapper.
Fix for Andreas' .gitignore stopping the new projects building ;-) Added back in the Func<IRouteCache> binding for the Ninject bootstrapper. Worked around the Ninject child container limitation by also registering the modules into the child container when it's constructed. This isn't ideal, as it's extra overhead per-request, and it still can't handle the parent container using "overrides" from the child, but it works, and the latter limitation is something that Ninject users should already be aware of and used to.
Added commented out request child container
Added StructureMap bootstrapper from Jonas Cannehag. Added Ninject bootstrapper from Ian Davis.
Added additional lifetime tests for the default bootstrapper.
Sealed some methods on the default bootstrapper to reduce noise. Only visible overrides should now be that stuff we expect end users to override, rather than including all the bits that bootstrap authors will override.
Overridable defaults for core types.
Fixed wonky csproj auto-merge
Integrated bug fixes by James Eggers and Steven Robbins
Added logical tests for the default bootstrapper to verify behaviour, lifetimes and overrides.
Added some logical tests for the bootstrapper base class to verify that the various overrides are called correctly when overridden.

More working tests.
Added parameter tests and fixed up DynamicDictionary
Enabled some more tests - showed a bug in the route resolver, now fixed.
Updated tinyioc - only a comment removed.
Pulled out per-request registration to an interface as some containers will manage lifetimes without child containers, but the interface still gives us some commonality for containers that support child containers for separating lifetimes.
Partial per-request demo - not currently working, need to fixup TinyIoC.
A couple of passign tests for NancyEngine.
Commented out a lot of tests to make them build. Deleted NancyApplicationFixture as it's not needed now.
removed strange rogue files :-)
Running example of the route cache.
Updated autofac bootstrapper, copied the demo code from the demo app and made it use a bootstrapper derived from autofac instead to make sure it works.
Initial stab at an autofac bootstrapper - probably doesn't work :-)
Additional commenting and added a derived bootstrapper to the sample project
Running bootstrapper spike.
More bootstrapper integration - routes currently broken and non-building

Added initial Spark projects and dependencies
Refactored code of AppDomainModuleLocator.cs
Fixed a failing test
