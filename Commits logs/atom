Currently, the updateClassList function on the TextEditorComponent does not properly re-add its managed classes (editor, is-focused, mini) to the element when the element has been re-rendered with changed classes passed in. This fixes the issue by always adding the newClassList classes to the element and relying on the element.classList.add to determine if the classes already exist (and should be ignored) Released under CC0

Fix documentation bug.
Update comment.
Rename a variable to reflect a change in the previous commit.
Two things: * Removed the `Directory` argument to `didSearchPaths`. Now each searcher gets its own instance of `didSearchPaths` that is parameterized by provider. * Simplified `DefaultDirectorySearcher.search()` so it creates one `DirectorySearch` rather than one per `Directory` passed to `search()`.
Comment excised, as recommended by @maxbrunsfeld.
Changed the behavior so that if a searcher rejects, then the thenable returned by `atom.workspace.scan()` rejects.
Changed the contract of `DefaultDirectorySearcher` in two significant ways: * `search()` takes an array of `Directory` objects rather than an individual object. * `options.didSearchPaths` now takes the `Directory` in addition to the `count` as an argument.
Changed DefaultDirectorySearcher to take multiple directories. Still need to update `workspace.coffee` to make better use of this.
Responded to all of @maxbrunsfeld's comments except for: * The effect of a failed search. * Letting `DirectorySearcher::search` take multiple directories.
Document and test the `cancel()` method on the object returned by `atom.workspace.scan()`.
Clean up test to verify that an individual failed search fails the overall search.
remove require for Disposable that is no longer needed
Make delegate method names more delegate-like.
Switch to the delegate pattern, eliminating a nasty race condition and deleting a lot of code.
Remove empty param lists as per the linter.
Two things: 1. Update documentation for `default-directory-search.coffee`. 2. Ensure that multiple `DirectorySearch` searches are run in series rather than in parallel to conserve resources.
Remove `myResolve` local variable that I was using for debugging.
Fix some nits I found during my self-review.
Change DirectorySearcher to return a DirectorySearch.
Respond to comments from @maxbrunsfeld and @kevinsawicki.
Introduce atom.directory-searcher service v0.1.0.

Regex searches are case-sensitive if any letter is capitalized.
Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/github/atom
Regex's in the command panel are treated as case-insensitive if there are no non-escaped letters in the pattern
RootView focuses the *first* focusable child.
Buffer.scanInRange can do a case-insensitive search
Second attempt: don't blow up when commenting in files w/ no language bundle
Load local bundles from ~/.atom/bundles
When focused, RootView retains focus itself if it has no focusable children
Optimization: Use absolute positioning instead of flexbox in editor
Merge branch 'master' of https://github.com/github/atom
RootView passes focus to a child element with a tabindex of -1 (if one exists)
RootView (instead of Window) handles opening an empty buffer if no path is given.
Don't explode on `meta-/` if there isn't a valid comment regex
When uncommenting multiple lines, don't raise an error if a line isn't commented

window.path is the thing now
Oh no, we can't set the title in the constructor because window hasn't been required yet!
making close work
more event killing

corey is anal
window open is working cool
Awesome shit.
Spaces between methods and properties. :lipstick:

Less logging.
I'm an idiot
project pane works. I call it Tree now though. Probably too generic, whatevs"
More resolving. More extension hotness.
Multiple windows can be opened, and their buffer state is saved.

README-CHRIS
added basic API to readme
added class layout
Don't get ahead of yourself.
I don't even know if this makes sense anymore. I need to think on it.
Atomicty app doesn't open everything (I don't think it can.)
my current thinking WIP
The main pane always exists so it is independent of plugin load order.
Shhhh
Editor is now a plugin! This means everything is pretty modular now (and the code is a little event heavy)
Radflish
README driven development
Remove context menus.
Fix references to editor.
this isn't working
Make tab text 'unselectable'
Moving event handling out of editor into window
Propagate the event, but only handle it once in the project plugin pane

first pass at key bindings. just replicating keymaster for now.
we should have a 10 minute talk about this again.
editor will be a plugin, for now force keybinding creation
filefinder working. I'll admit, I half-assed getting this one into the new format.
tinytest!

Modes work again
Added 'load' method for plugins.

So we don't screw up and press cmd-ctrl-r from the console.
More methods from common.js fs.
yellow was so jarring, wikipedia says this is one of the most calming colors.
clean up jscocoa properly

tweak spacing in project drawer
This was causing errors. I don't even get how this would work.
@defunkt put that in your ~/.atomicity file, it's erring in my console!

box-flow all the things
