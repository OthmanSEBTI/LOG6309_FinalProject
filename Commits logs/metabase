require all table-defs from describe-* driver functions to include a :schema attribute (which can still be nil).

adding newly flushed out sync-database/* namespaces and their functions.  This handles an introspection process which scans the db an flushes the resulting data into RawTables/RawColumns followed by a sync process which updates working data model metadata.

introduce models for RawTable and RawColumn.
tweak describe-table and describe-table-fks to accept the DatabaseInstance directly as an argument.

publish a `:database-update` event and create an event listener which calls our driver notify-database-updated method whenever we get a :database-update event.
add a new optional driver method for `notify-database-updated` which allows drivers to be informed when their databases are updated. then implement this method on the generic-sql driver and use it to actively shutdown any open connection pool on the updated database so that we can recreate it as needed.
update the connection-spec acquisition code for our generic SQL driver to unify it based on acquiring a connection for a given DATABASE and to replace the memoize/ttl with our own atom for caching db connection pools to each database.

tweaks to revision system to allow for more options describing deltas: * updated IRevisioned protocol to add a `(diff-map)` function which provides a structured description of the change. * renamed `(describe-diff)` on IRevisioned protocol to `(diff-str)` just for naming consistency. * reworked some of the code around how revision details are added to revisions * new default version of `(diff-map)` for existing revisions objects * cleanup on unit tests, etc.
Rename metabaseadmin modules to metabase.admin for consistency

track the dirty state of our form and don't show the 'send test email' button when the form is dirty.

simplify a few things with the management of our EmailSettings form.  swap the location of the buttons on the form.
adjust the email endpoint for sending a test email to always just use the locally saved settings.
more updates to Email settings frontend to support then new api endpoint at /api/email/*, to complete handling of the full saving states including success indicators on our action buttons, and to support a new option for sending a test email.
update our email messages test to account for changes to default values in our smtp email settings.
add a new api path for /api/email/* which has endpoints specific to dealing with email settings and testing.
modify the `send-message` function to optionally accept a `:details` kwarg which specifies the smtp details to use when sending the email.  if not supplied we fall back on our normal smtp details from the application settings.
when applying multiple settings, if a value is set to nil treat it as a delete.
all the basic elements of a unified SMTP settings page are now working.
add a new function for `(set-all [map])` in the settings model and add a new api endpoint for PUT /api/setting/ which allows applying multiple settings in a single api call.
small fix.
fix unit test.
fix the issue with edit boxes losing input on the metadata page by using our full database metadata endpoint to load all our necessary information at one time.  part of the underlying problem is that we were looping over the tables to get the metadata and each time the data updated we re-rendered our form and it would clear existing input, so while loading was happening it was easy to lose your input.
remove old CSRF code that was only relevant to django app.
consolidate all of the angular API service code into the main services.js file.  we were mostly going this route already, but this just makes it simple and puts all the api code in a single place.

quick tweak to revision code to avoid protocol implementations on classes as basic as java.lang.Object so that functions like `satisfies?` can be useful.  this simply removes the base implementation of IRevisioned from java.lang.Object and instead defines a couple default implementations of the protocol functions which entities can reuse.  also, we remove the base implementation of `serialize-instance` because that just feels dangerous and we want to encourage each entity to provide its own version of that function.

finish off card activity handling by adding in ability to track the database & table associated with an activity item.
finish off the handling of dashboard events which feed into the activity feed.
begin processing dashboard events for activity feed.
be consistent about using :custom_id instead of :tracking-hash or other ways of specifying an activity custom identifier.
update the database sync event publication so that we can actually track start & end as separate events but part of the same activity.  to do so we add a :tracking-hash to the events when they are published which is meant to remain consistent throughout the sync, then we implement our activity tracking code so that we can lookup an existing activity item and update it based on the custom hash.
publish and :install event and listen for it in our activity feed so that we can create the first entry.  also, implement user login event handling so that we can identify when a user logs in for the first time and we can publish an activity feed entry for :user-joined.
track user-login events.
create a new GET /api/activity endpoint for listing activity items.
couple more bits of cleanup to ensure we are publishing the right events.
start writing our activity events to the db!
streamlining more of the event bus and activity stuff and rounding things out.  adding new migration which creates the `activity` table.
rounding out a few things.  now have all persistent functions for cards & dashboards publishing activity events.
basic pub/sub framework using core.async

fix typo
add in some code for handling older card queries where filters had a couple different structures.
rename env var MB_TEST_DATASETS. Abstact out test dataset logic into metabase.test.data.datasets
we never actually want to set the card visualization_settings, we simply want to pull the necessary settings and have them available when rendering is going to occur.
MB_TEST_AGAINST_DRIVERS can be used to run QP unit tests against a subset of drivers

don't show the "add another filter ..." link if the previous filter is incomplete.
fixing issues with value handling when multiple field values were being used.
if the user chooses the "rows" aggregation then always give them a "table" visualization to start with.
when a user changes the aggregation to "rows" we clear out any breakouts chosen because it's not relevant to have breakouts with "rows".
force better immutability in React components by using angular.copy() on values we inject as props to ensure the react components don't have access to the mutable versions from our controllers.
when the user selects a new table on their gui query we now clear all the other query elements because it's likely they no longer make sense.
improve error reporting on card Saver.
don't show download link if the query resulted in an error.
make pin_map a visualization choice again.
make our Visualization more "pure" by implementing shouldComponentUpdate() and avoiding cases where the chart was re-rendering all the time even though the actual visualized data hadn't changed.
show a simple default message in the visualization informing the user to run a query in order to see something so they don't get confused by seeing a bunch of blank space.
show a message when the query returns 0 rows of results rather than just an empty window.
handle cases where dataset query api responds with a non-200 response.
automatically set the card display to scalar if we detect a 1x1 result the first time someone runs a query.
enhance the Table visualization component to accept a maxRows property which limits the displayed table length.  for now we set our table visualization on the card builder to a max of 500 rows until we support paging.

Big refactor of Sync functionality
use a local var for the 'queryBuilder' and remove the use of $scope.model because we don't actually need to put anything in the scope to allow React to do its thing.
remove the query-builder directive which we really don't need and handle all our rendering in our controller.
tidy up some of our AppState promise code and make it easier to reason and a bit more concise.
force our homepage controller to resolve our app init process before executing to avoid issues with redirect logic not working because we don't have appropriate state information yet.

add a couple of conveniences to emailreport and emailreport-executions models.

add a new function for `(now-with-format)` which accepts a single argument which is a date format as a string and formats the current time to the given format.  this makes it easy to get the current time in any format the caller wants.

update the implementation for our NavController to simply use our new 'appContext' value from the AppState service.  this keeps the route parsing logic in AppState as well as ensuring a better initialization path.

do some final cleanup and bug fixing and implement the final bit that takes the results of our dataset query, extracts the lat/lon points, and feeds them into our PinMap overlay java class for rendering.  everything should be working end to end now.
add in support for "INSIDE" subclause of :filter clause so that we can do bounded box queries that are needed for pin maps.  also did some updates on unit tests.
add /api/tiles routes to the api routes and implement the /api/tiles/* endpoint for rendering pin map overlay image.  this endpoint is currently not finished and working while we wait on getting the "inside" filter clause working in the query processor.
add a java class for `GoogleMapPinsOverlay` which uses java image manipulation libs to create an image from a set of lat/lon coordinates.  tried doing this in clojure but in the end the Java libs seemed the better route and there was just enough Java code to warrant an actual Java class.

Merge pull request #5 from metabase/ag-liquibase
fix up a few things in unit tests and make sure everything is working now.
add user and userorgperm models.
don't include :entity_fields on base entity because that forces those columns to be returned on EVERY query, which is not always desired.  instead we need to find a way to make the fields list composable.
add more of the schema to the liquibase initial migration.  we are now covering user, organization, and userorgperm tables.  also, for debugging purposes the app main method will dump the liquibase sql into a script in /tmp/script.sql so that we can check it out and run it manually while we work through creating the liquibase changelog.
switch back to lowercase tables/column names which seems to be the most compatible approach.
specify cider-nrepl pluging version "0.9.0-SNAPSHOT" instead of "LATEST" which is "0.8.2"
small fix to remove reference to file not checked in yet.
