Attemp to fix #697
Fix 'AnyObject' in comment and README.md
The ‘isBool’ function on the NSNumber extension uses ‘trueObjCType’, which represents the type encoding for ‘true’ represented as an NSNumber, and ‘falseObjCType’, which represents the type encoding for ‘false’ represented as an NSNumber. Both type encodings are equal to ‘c’. However, an NSNumber that wraps around a value of type Int8 also has a type encoding of ‘c’. Therefore, a user who passes in a value of 0 or 1 (of type Int8) into JSON will expect to see the numbers 0 or 1 as the output because that was the intent. Unfortunately, that value will be wrapped into NSNumber and be considered a bool, so the user will see ‘true’ or ‘false’ instead.

While NSJSONSerialization states that it will throw, invalid JSON will make it throw prior to parsing. Apple recommends checking for valid JSON first.
