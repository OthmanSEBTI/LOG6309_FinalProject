Fix a regression caused by 805eddaefd9503b5dbbd924bd6da66e29c4768f3
Fix #4431
Setting the flag to FALSE is unnecessary since it defaults to FALSE, therefore this block of code can be reduced to a single statement
Set the _key_exists flag to TRUE when the key does in fact exist.  Set it to FALSE if the ID is being regenerated, and set it to TRUE once it's been written.
Add a flag to determine whether the redis key currently exists, and if not, force creation of it at write-time

Removed extra from $name, since it does not follow the format of other form_ helpers. Form helpers use $extra as a string.

Cache Driver - Backup Never Loaded The condition that checks to see if the backup driver input is valid was prefixing the input with "cache_". Since the valid driver values don't have this prefix, the condition was always returning FALSE and the backup drivers were never being loaded. I've removed the prefix in the condition and added a debug log message for when the backup driver is used.
config->item() now returns NULL instead of FALSE when the required item doesn't exist.

Further update to `element()` to remove more unexpected results.
Having `"0"` in an array would give you NULL with `elements()`. BAD! The trouble here, is that when we are expecting a valid result, such as `0`, or `false` that the array helper will instead say "I don't know if there is a value" and give you a `null`.

Added support for $_SERVER['CI_ENV'] in index.php Remember this is entirely optional, nothing will change if you do not which to use Multiple Environments just like right now. If you DO set CI_ENV you can manipulate the switch that controls error reporting, etc, so set it to "production" on your live site to hide errors from users. If you don't require this logic you can remove it, or change it entirely to check HTTP_HOST for environment subdomains, or check IP address, etc.

User_agent library improvements
Escaping boolean data type, some DBMS (e.g., postgre) need it
simpler script, add boolean handling on DB_driver/escape
Generate better conditions statement on boolean field type. Actually boolean field type need TRUE or FALSE value. Common DBMS (e.g., MySQL) can substite this value with 1 or 0, but it can't be implemented on PostgreSQL. So, its better to use TRUE or FALSE value for boolean field type.

DB Utility improvements  - Replaced driver methods _list_databases(), _optimize_table() and _repair_table() with properties  - Added defaults for optimize_table() and repair_table() SQL strings (FALSE, as those are mostly MySQL-specific)  - Added MSSQL/SQLSRV support for optimize_table() (actually rebuilds table indexes)  - Switched public driver methods to protected  - Improved CUBRID support for list_databases() as it used to only return the currently used database  - Minor speed improvements
Switched public driver methods in DB forge to protected
Multiple DB Forge improvements  - Replaced driver methods _create_database(), _drop_database(), _drop_table() and _rename_table() with properties  - Added defaults for the above mentioned platform-specific queries, so that not all drivers need to define them  - Improved support for the SQLite, ODBC and PDO drivers

Bumped CodeIgniter's PHP requirement to 5.2.4. Yes I know PHP 5.4 just came out, and yes I know PHP 5.3 has lovely features, but there are plenty of corporate systems running on CodeIgniter and PHP 5.3 still is not widely supported enough. CodeIgniter is great for distributed applications, and this is the highest we can reasonably go without breaking support. PHP 5.3 will most likely happen in another year or so. Fingers crossed on that one anyway...

Merge pull request #730 from JackWebbHeller/patch-1
Removed `$_SERVER['REMOTE_ADDR']` following feedback
CodeIgniter ignores the set config value for Maximum Execution Time, overwriting it with its own value of 300 seconds. Whilst this is sensible in the vast majority of situations (browsers), when running a script from CLI, it is likely that execution times may need to be longer. Therefore, don't override the time limit if being run from the CLI - instead default back to PHP's own configuration.

Moved the "is_unique" change log to 2.1.0-dev where it should have been first time. Sorry about that one, had to manually separate 2.0.3 changes from 2.1.0 based mainly on memory.
Removed some error suppression, which would hide a Notice if the path cannot be read. I discovered this by foolishly passing the file_path, not the full_path but took forever for me to realise this as the error returned (thanks to this error suppression) was "GD is not installed" instead of "File cannot be read". Seeing that notice would have made much more sense.

Modifying smiley_js() in the smiley helper to add optional third parameter to return only the javascript with no script tags.

typography tweaks

Continued working on typography class and docs



More tweaks
more tweaks!

Simplified the typography conversion routine... I hope I didn't break something.
Tweaked the auto_typography function
massaged regex for double spaces after sentences

replaced format_characters()' logic replacement with a more straightforward and accurate regex replacement.  The former handled some odd improper punctuation in a more predictable manner, but as a result failed to render many proper punctuation cases correctly.  The new method is a good tradeoff, getting all "correct" punctuation rendered properly with better performance.
Added support for removing javascript event handlers from tags, for security reasons

Moved the "auto typography" class into its own class file in the libraries folder
Fixed a typo

Did some reorganizing
Allowed empty rules to be set, and fixed a bug that allows blank error messages to output the delimiters.
Removed quick reference from table of contents, as it's from version 1.3.  Much has changed since then.
