Allow `get` or `set` parentheses-less function calls when first argument is a string without a colon (so a plain string, not a property accessor)

Throw an error for ambiguous `get` or `set` function calls or ES5 getter/setter keywords, to warn the user to use parentheses if they intend a function call (or to inform them that `get` or `set` cannot be used as a keyword)

Merge pull request #4378 from GeoffreyBooth/fix-browser-tests
Refactor the way test.html runs tests to be similar to how Cakefile runs them; most importantly, tests fail when the `test` function throws an exception, not when `ok` does (which happens intentionally a few times in the classes tests); this also produces a more accurate count of tests run

Closes #4036: "Try catch" optimisation Let me know if there's something I should be doing differently as this is my first contribution to coffeescript. I fixed the reported issue where a generated variable could clash with a user-defined one in a try/catch block. I added a test for a few scenarios with different variable names for a try/catch, to confirm the fix and avoid regressions.

Merge pull request #3014 from mset/master
Bug fix. When coffee is invoked with the -c parameter and './' value, first two characters of the directory into which the compiled files are stored get chopped off. Example: if compilation invoked like this: 'coffee -o ../lib/ -cw ./', then Source file: ./OutputFolder/file.coffee, compiled output: ./../lib/tputFolder/ The code only expected '.' to mark the local folder. However, './' is equally valid.

another wish
docs
added a wish list to the docs
doc tweaks
changing switch/case to switch/when -- it's a better word
added comprehensive linting to the test suit
fixed the broken try/catch grammar
with a more comprehensive execution test that uncovered some missing spots
added some execution test
added readme
first draft of docs are done
waypoint
added git st with the new operator regex
ported over a little more underscore
added the ! sign as an allowed operator
...
more better super docs, better switch docs
added yes, no, on and off as boolean aliases and a nice aliases section to the docs
broken waypoint, but fixed line numbers with the new JS comments
broken waypoint, but fixed line numbers with the new JS comments
for whatever reason, don't need to force else-bodies to compile as statements anymore ... let them do what they want
removed all traces of 'extends' -- it's not any shorter or more convenient than just setting the prototype
got comments within object and array literals working out
first draft of parsing and printing along comments -- unfortunately, not yet working within objects and arrays
passing through comments as tags on Values, but not printing them out quite yet...
nice -- it's pushing down assignments properly (recursively) now
moderate refactor of nodes.rb -- tests pass and examples compile without warnings
clean up children at exit -- had about twenty processes all watching and recompiling the docs
documentation waypoint
added full complement of bitwise operators
added full complement of bitwise operators
making the each fixture a little more like underscore, and avoiding passing assignment into functions from the outside
added the verbose option to the CLI
more little fixes, lots of subtle things, added a verbose logging mode
lots of tweaks make the tests pass again
patched up array comprehensions somewhat. Parens are still a necessary evil, and there's still probably plenty of edge cases
little fixes more examples
adding css for syntax highlighting
todo to-done
finished the first draft of the parser test
adding comprehensive attr_readers to the AST for testing
parser test raises some minor improvements (remove unnecessary ValueNode arrays, etc
adding an initial lexer test
after a lot of grammar wrestling, got the if-else chains to parse unambiguously. Now you only need a single period to close chains of any length.
finally got the function/object/variable assignment indentation straightened out, I think
compiling if-else chains into nice flat ones
first major rework of the nodes -- still need more comments and templatish cleanup, but character tagging is all settled
renamed Nodes to Expressions
finished commenting everything but the nodes -- they're up next
finished commenting the grammar
many more comments, plus a fix for inner-assignment indentation
commented the command-line interface
moved the TextMate bundle into the gem, added a command to install it
added the 'delete' operator
removed the 'default' keyword in favor of an 'else'
removed class checks in favor of statement?
number examples
added exponential and hex numbers
added a nice --watch mode to continually recompile or relint (or reprint) your coffeescripts
cleanups getting underscore to compile
added nice syntax errors
passing through values with line number information that look and act like Ruby natives
cleaned up lexer in order to add line numbers
added the ability to super()
allowing inner slashes in regexes
supporting escaped quotes in strings
supporting escaped quotes in strings
multiline strings
multiline strings
built the first gem -- works just fine
completely reorganized for a gem and the 'coffee-script' command
--
down to the last shift reduce conflict -- leading and trailing whitespace
a smarter lexer brings us down to three shift/reduces
two more shift/reduces down, 8 to go
renamed it all to CoffeeScript
with an 'expect 10', chapter one of mysterylang is written
fixed a ton of shift/reduces by adding order of ops -- let's do more
--
got case statements wokring
 --
made array comprehensions into expressions
fixing object assignment indentation
 --
array comprehensions can pass the index
a bit more underscore
add free variable name lookup. Now that we have lexical scope, array comprehensions are greatly improved
got lexical scoping working -- even fancier returns with assignment as the last statement in a function body
with shelling out to javascript
got postfix if and unless onboard
more todos
more todos
first draft of array comprehensions, but they stink.
added break and continue
lots of goodies -- smart reducing of redunant parentheses, auto function returns now get passed down into statements.
with try-catch working
reduce/reduce conflicts are gone
one more reduce/reduce down
ignoring the parser debugging
back to code
simplified expressions heirarchy
not getting anywhere
more more, including &&=, ||=
moving right along
line cleaning -- arglists are broken broken
initial commit of the mystery language
