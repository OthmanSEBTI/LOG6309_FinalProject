Bugfix
Remove TODO
Using copy function.
Rewrite PearRepository to implement PEAR Client/Server protocol itself, taking longer then pear remote-list, but at least showing ALL available versions, making arbitrary dependencies possible.
Add support for PEAR repository and downloading, example composer.json would look like {"repositories":{"doctrine": {"pear":"http://pear.doctrine-project.org"},"requires":{"DoctrineORM":"2.0.5"}}. You can use pear repositories this way for now. PEAR packages are not downloaded via pear, only via their .tgz packages in the PEAR repository. Automatically detecting dependencies will require reverse-engineering the PEAR protocol a little bit more, however from looking at a pirum output it looks simple.
