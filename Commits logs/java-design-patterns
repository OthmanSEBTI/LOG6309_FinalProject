Merge pull request #800 from trumvekhuya/master
Intermittent failure was due to Thread.sleep in the code. While performing unit test cases there was race condition between two threads, so it was not guaranteed to work every time. Used an interface DelayProvider for simulating delay, and while unit testing fake delay provider is used that eradicates the use of Threads in unit test cases, which is not a good practice.
Resolved PMD issues
1) Refactored LotteryNumbers to use Joiner from guava library to join lottery numbers. 2) Solved potential thread safety issue in LotteryTicketId class, where it was using raw primitive value and incrementing it which is not thread-safe. So used AtomicInteger for brevity 3) assertEquals arguments were in incorrect order at many places, so changed order of those 4) Replaced assertFalse and assertTrue at some places with assertEquals and assertNotEquals for reducing complexity of code 5) Removed public modifiers from test cases, as they are no more needed by JUnit 5

As getAll method returns a Stream, we cannot close the involved resources (Connection, Statement and resultSet) until the stream is closed by the consumer. So try-with-resources is not an option as per sonarqube’s recommendation. But it is still recommended to close statement and result set. When connection pool used, connection is not closed when close() called. It is just returned to the pool.
