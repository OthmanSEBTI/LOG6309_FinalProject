Removed debug logging.
Slight change to do a cheap string comparison before checking against set membership. Could probably be even better (especially with fine-grained notifications).
OS X client now also marks DrawPaths as ended (drawerID = "") to help performance on iOS devices.
Removed the shake to deleteAllObjects functionality.
Attempt at optimizing rendering by keeping track of active vs inactive DrawPaths. Inactive DrawPaths have ended (touchesEnded) and thus will not change again. They are drawn to an offscreen image that is then the base layer while active paths are drawn on top. This might result in less than 100% _visual_ parity between devices, but this is fixable if needed.
Removed unused code.
Fixed sync across 32/64 bit devices.
