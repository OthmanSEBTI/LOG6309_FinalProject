Version bump to 1.0.0 Small spelling correction Contributors list updated
Version bump to 1.0.0-rc1 Fixed memory calculation problem in NetBSD where the amount of memory overflowed a 32-bit integer.  Used "sysctl -n hw.physmem64" rather than "sysctl -n hw.physmem" in those situations. (Thanks to Dave Burgess) Fixed an issue where the script would suggest adding skip-isam to the MySQL configuration in 4.0.x, but the directive wasn't available until 4.1.1. (Thanks to Ryan Novosielski) Fixed an issue with MySQL 5.1 where table_open_cache needed to be adjusted, rather than open_cache. (Thanks to Michael Scheidell and Blair Christensen) Adjusted some misleading wording when MySQL's memory usage is very high relative to the amount of physical memory installed. Increased threshold to 90%. (Thanks to Hans du Plooy) Fixed an issue where MySQL logins failed when a socket was specified but a .my.cnf file was also present. (Thanks to Victor Trac) Added full support for Solaris. (Big thanks to Bill Bradford)

Fixed an issue where the key buffer calculation caused errors when no indexes were present Added Giovanni Bechis, Greg Eden, Aubin Galinotti, Mark Imbriaco and Bill Bradford to the contributors list
Version bump to 0.9.8 Added new options to help output Made version checking off by default, enabled by --checkversion option

Fixed an issue with table_cache in MySQL 6.x (it's now table_open_cache in MySQL 6.x)
Version bump to 0.9.0 Fixed a bug where NULL may appear when enumerating tables on MySQL 5 MySQLTuner now checks for updates and allows the checks to be disabled
Version bump to 0.8.9 Added an option to skip the enumeration/sizing of tables (--skipsize), which should help on servers with lots of tables Changed the table enumeration/sizing method for MySQL 5 to use information_schema (increased performance drastically) Adjusted the query_cache_limit recommendation to include the currently set value, rather than 1M each time Changed the wording for tmp_table_size/max_heap_table_size to make it less confusing
Version bump. Added Shawn Ashlee to contributors.
Added lines between sections to increase readability. Corrected a bug where storage engine statuses were still in color even with --nocolor. Excluded information_schema tables from calculations (they were showing up as usual MEMORY tables).
Bumped to version 0.8.5 Fixed copy/paste bug with OK/!!/-- output (Thanks to Nils!) Fixed a data length calculation bug in MySQL 4.0.x Fixed a key buffer calculation bug in MySQL 4.0.x Added in a notification for situations when no recommendations are available Added Nils Breunese to the contributors list

Removing a minor left over comment
Fixed a bug in MySQL 3.23 where the storage engine checks had problems Adjusted some of the Perl code to be more compact, organized, and factored
Fix for the bugfix in r24.
Version bump and tab fix
Fixed two bugs relating to the database crawler when database names contained a hyphen. (Thanks to Mike Jackson)
Added lots of InnoDB support Flipped spaces to tabs Added more storage engine checks Adjusted output display
* Added innodb_log_file_size checks * Added 32-bit/64-bit checks and warnings (maximum memory > 2GB = bad) * Fixed temporary table recommendation bug (would never recommend increase) * Fixed thread cache recommendations/warnings * Merged increase/decrease variable recommendations into one category
* Changed indexing calculations so that all tables are not opened in MySQL 5 (thanks Jon!) * Adjusted some of the commented lines at the top of the script
* Added NetBSD support (thanks to Dave Burgess) * Switched username/password prompts to STDERR so they won't appear in printouts
* Adjusted infoprint to use asterisks (cosmetic) * Per-thread/global buffer counts are now displayed * Key buffer increases are only recommended if the buffer is smaller than total indexes and key buffer hit rate is < 95% * Dropped max_seeks_for_key checks * Temporary table size increases are not recommended over 256M * Aborted connection calculation and recommendation adjustments
Very small bugfix for MySQL 3.23 on line 408
Added aborted connection checks Added % reads/writes counts Adjusted recommendations for slow query logging, max seeks per key, and joins without indexes
Minor fix if no selects have been run (Thanks Kevin)
Fixed a dumb logic error with the concurrent_insert check
Minor divide by zero error in query cache calculations
Tremendous overhaul of massive proportions. Thanks to suggestions from Mike Jackson, BK Box, Bryan Tholen, and Shawn Ashlee. MySQLTuner's new home is now at: http://rackerhacker.com/mysqltuner/ The big feature changes will be documented there.
Adjusted key_buffer_size logic checks.\nChanged max_connections wording.\nAdded max_seeks_for_key check.
Added explanations for key max_connections and fixed a Plesk bug when you run the script as a non-root user
Fixed bug with 'explainonly' argument.
Added option to disable colors. Explanation option is disabled by default.
Completed long explanation portion for slow query log section. Created 'explainonly' command line argument for long explanations only. Adjusted memory usage long explanation.
Initial verbose explain output configuration (there you go Mike!)
Massive changes... output filtering, usage information, and temporary table corrections with regards to max memory calculations
Changed all prints to use subroutines to allow for exclusions via command line arguments (coming up next)
Script now requires MySQL 4.1 or higher (4.0 is EOL, and support for that is lame...)
Corrected memory calculation issue in OS X / Darwin
Added check to see if MySQL is even installed
Initial Import
