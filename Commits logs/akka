Replace errorLogging with GraphStage - resolves #19899
When RARP is being shutdown, it pipes result of the shutdown of transport to self. remote's shutdown is using `ask` pattern, so it can produce `Status.Failure`, which is not handled in RARP's state `WaitTransportShutdown`. For fixing it added matching for `Status.Failure` and changed `RemoteTransport`'s shutdown signature to use `akka.Done`, which looks more consistent with other shutdown's and `akka.Done` is more verbose than previously used `Unit`.

We could delay this decision of starting local routees, but that would allow messages to be dead-letter-ed (bad).

Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jboner/akka
Removed call to 'start()' in the constructor of ClusterActorRef
Minor refactoring and restructuring
1. Makes sure to check if 'akka.enabled-modules=["cluster"]' is set before checking if the akka-cluster.jar is on the classpath, allowing non-cluster deployment even with the JAR on the classpath 2. Fixed bug with duplicate entries in replica set for an actor address 3. Turned on clustering for all Multi JVM tests
1. Added configuration option for 'preferred-nodes' for a clustered actor. The replica set is now tried to be satisfied by the nodes in the list of preferred nodes, if that is not possible, it is randomly selected among the rest. 2. Added test for it. 3. Fixed wrong Java fault-tolerance docs 4. Fixed race condition in maintenance of connections to new nodes

Made the node holding the ClusterActorRef being potentially part of the replica set for the actor it is representing. 4. Changed and cleaned up ClusterNode API, especially the ClusterNode.store methods. 5. Commented out ClusterNode.remove methods until we have a full story how to do removal 6. Renamed Peter's PeterExample test to a more descriptive name 7. Added round robin router test with 3 replicas 8. Rewrote migration tests to actually test correctly 9.

Minor changes and some added FIXMEs
Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jboner/akka
- Changed implementation of Actor.actorOf to work in the the new world of cluster.ref, cluster.use and cluster.store. - Changed semantics of replica config. Default replicas is now 0. Replica 1 means one copy of the actor is instantiated on another node. - Actor.remote.actorFor/Actor.remote.register is now separated and orthogonal from cluster implementation. - cluster.ref now creates and instantiates its replicas automatically, e.g. it can be created first and will then set up what it needs. - Added logging everywhere, better warning messages etc. - Each node now fetches the whole deployment configuration from the cluster on boot. - Added some config options to cluster

Merge branch 'master' of github.com:jboner/akka
Moved secure cookie exchange to on connect established, this means I could remove the synchronization on send, enabling muuuch more throughput, also, since the cookie isn`t sent in each message, message size should drop considerably when secure cookie handshakes are enabled. I do however have no way of testing this since it seems like the clustering stuff is totally not working when it comes to the RemoteSupport

Added support for 'deputy-nodes'.
Added support for "leader election", the isLeader method and leader election tests. Also fixed bug in scrutinizer not maintaining the 'seen' map.
Renamed Gossiper to Node (and selfNode to vclockNode).
Split up ClusterDaemon into ClusterGossipDaemon (routed with configurable N instances) and ClusterCommandDaemon (shortly to be an FSM). Removed ConnectionManager crap.
Created test tag LongRunningTest ("long-running") for excluding long running (cluster) tests from standard suite.
Added support for checking for Cluster Convergence and completed support for MembershipChangeListener (including tests).
Fixed remaining issues with gossip based failure detection and removal of unreachable nodes.
Added testkit time ratio sensitive durations.
Removed printed stack trace from remote client/server errors. Just annoying when client hangs retrying and does not provide any real value since they are the same every time.
Fixed error in merge.
Merged with master
Fixed bug in failure detector which also fixes bug in cluster scrutinize service. Also added test case for the bug.
Disabling out erroneous cluster 'scrutinize' service until fixed and proper tests are written.
Renamed NodeGossipingSpec to NodeMembershipSpec since it is testing consistency of the cluster node membership table
Finalized initial cluster membership and merging of vector clocks and gossips in case of concurrent cluster updates. Plus misc other fixes.
Rewrite of the VectorClock impl. Now with 'merge' support and slicker API. Also added more tests.
Added NodeGossipingSpec for testing gossiping and cluster membership.
Implemented 'receive(newGossip)' plus misc other changes and fixes.
Added 'or' method to Versioned.
Refactored Gossip state and management. Introduced GossipOverview with convergence info, renamed some fields, added some new cluster commands.
Skips gossipping and cluster scrutinization if singleton cluster.
Switching node status to Up if singleton cluster. Added 'switchStatusTo' method. Updated the test. Profit.
Completed singleton and N-node cluster boot up and joining phase.
Removed cluster seed nodes, added 'join.contact-point', changed joining phase, added singleton cluster mode plus misc other changes.
Changes to cluster specification.
