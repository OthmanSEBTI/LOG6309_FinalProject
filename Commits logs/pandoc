Added --jsmath option.
Fixed Setup.hs so correct status is returned after build.
Changed compactify in Text.Pandoc.Shared - better heuristic.
Don't print a line break between a footnote and immediately following nonspace in LaTeX and ConTeXt output, as it is interpreted as a space. This is problematic for cases like "text^[note]---". Modified wrappedTeX (in Text.Pandoc.Shared).  Resolves Issue #93.
HTML reader: Don't interpret contents of <pre> blocks as markdown. Added rawVerbatimBlock parser.  Resolves Issue #94.
Include classes on tr elements in HTML output:  "header", "odd", "even". This allows tables to be styled with lines in alternating colors. Resolves Issue #91.
Changed date on copyright message in Main.hs.
pandoc-setup.iss:  Don't require admin privileges to run installer.
Modified modpath.iss to modify HKCU path if user lacks admin privileges. Also fixed case where oldpath is empty (previously this led to the new path beginning with a semicolon).

Use Data.List's 'intercalate' instead of custom 'joinWithSep'.
Fixed haddock bug in Text/Pandoc/LaTexMathML.hs.
LaTeX reader: Refactored math parsers, limited support for eqnarray.
LaTeX reader:  Removed specialEnvironment parser.
LaTeX reader:  minor improvements. + parse '{}', if present, after \textless, \textgreater,   \textbar, \textbackslash, \ldots. + Parse unescaped special characters verbatim rather than   changing them to spaces.  This way arguments of unknown   commands will appear in braces.
LaTeX reader: Fixed regression in list parsing (introduced by recent changes to unknownCommand).
Pandoc is no longer a native debian package. It is easier for releases if debian packaging is separate.
Updated INSTALL in light of new dependencies (utf8-string and zip-archive).
LaTeX reader:  improvements in raw LaTeX parsing.
MediaWiki writer:  print class attributes in <pre> for code blocks, if any.
Changed Float to Double in definition of Table element. (Double is more efficient in GHC.) Truncate width in opendocument output to 2 decimal places.
Reworked Text.Pandoc.ODT to use zip-archive instead of calling external 'zip'.
Modified Text.Pandoc.Biblio to fit new citeproc API.
Removed PDF writer from core pandoc, restored markdown2pdf.
LaTeX reader:  Parse "code" environments as verbatim (lhs). Refactored parsers for verbatim environments.
Bugs fixed in RunTests.hs: + 'r' -> '\r' + use a strict version of readFile to make sure file is closed   and can be removed
Modified RunTests.hs to strip out '\r' so it will work on Windows.
Simplified and improved UTF8 handling:
PDF writer: Close output file handle after waitForProcess. It should be closed automatically, but perhaps this fails on Windows, especially when the process is interrupted?
Support for display math; changed ASCIIMathML -> LaTeXMathML: Resolves Issue #47.
Don't expose Text.Pandoc.Biblio module unless citeproc option is selected.
Small haddock documentation fix.  (Andrea Rossato)

Parse raw ConTeXt environments as TeX in markdown reader. Resolves Issue #73.
Added new markdown reader tests to list of extra source files in pandoc.cabal.
ODT writer:  Use '/', even on Windows, as path separator in xlink attribute for images.  Otherwise OpenOffice can't find the image files.
Makefile: Added 'configure' as dependency of 'uninstall-all'. (It uses the Cabal build program.)
Allow newline before URL in markdown link references.  Resolves Issue #81. Added tests for this issue in new "markdown-reader-more" tests. Changed RunTests.hs to run these tests.
Use -S option when building man pages in Setup.hs.
Man writer:  don't escape " as \".
Updated man page sources with pdf output option, minor cosmetic changes.
Added zip as a build dependency in debian/control.
Debian packaging changes:
Removed markdown2pdf and all references to it.
Added Text.Pandoc.PDF module, 'pdf' as new output option.
Use 'bracket' to improve withTempDir Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Removed dependency on reference.odt from Makefile. This is handled now in Setup.hs.
Removed no-longer-needed wrappers directory.
Removed no-longer-needed templates directory.
Moved more of the build process from Makefile to Setup.hs:
Removed layout-cache and Configurations2 from odt-styles directory. They don't seem to be needed.
Include shell scripts themselves in repo, rather than generating from wrappers.
Added preconfigure hook to build reference.odt if missing.
Rewrote test suite so it doesn't depend on perl or unix tools.
Removed unneeded space after "\\item" in LaTeX and ConTeXt output.
Added Text.Pandoc.UTF8 as a backup for when utf8-string is not present.
Small improvements to citation parsing in markdown reader. (Don't allow blank lines inside citations.)
Allow parsing of multiline citations.
Text/Pandoc/Biblio.hs - made getRefs point-free.
Mention ODT writer in pandoc.cabal.
Added padding to table cells in ODT.
Added opendocument writer tests.
Added support for Cite to Markdown reader, and conditional support for citeproc module. + The citeproc cabal configuration option sets the _CITEPROC macro, which conditionally   includes code for handling citations. + Added Text.Pandoc.Biblio module. + Made highlighting option default to False.
Added Cite element to definition and writers.
Improved configuration options and CPP macros.
Added 'utf8' configuration flag to pandoc.cabal. This makes it possible to compile pandoc without utf8, using '-f-utf8' at configuration time.  Utf-8 support is still the default.
Improvements to ODT writer (for windows compatibility):
INSTALL: Included instructions on installing utf8-string.
Replaced markdown2odt with pandoc in web demos.
Added information about `odt` to README and pandoc(1) man page.
Improved template handling:
Removed superfluous copyFile from Text/Pandoc/ODT.hs.
Fixes to make haddock work with template haskell: + Added CPP, TemplateHaskell, FlexibleInstances to cabal file "Extensions" field + Added #ifndef __HADDOCK__ cpp declarations in the files using template haskell.
Removed FlexibleInstances Extension line from pandoc.cabal; it isn't needed because the relevant files have pragmas.
Use </> with contentsOf to ensure that paths are portable. Do not use hardcoded '/' characters!
ODT writer:  Don't use pathname in invoking "zip", as that causes problems in windows.
Added pragma to HTML writer to avoid deprecation warning for use of "start" attribute.
Added pragma to Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs to get rid of "orphan instance" warnings. (These are caused by the Lift instance for ByteString.)
Removed 'CPP' from Extension in pandoc.cabal. It is not needed (since the relevant files have a pragma anyway), and it causes problems on windows (Cabal thinks pandoc.cabal has changed every time configure is run).
Don't use OverloadedStrings in ODT writer. Remove version dependency from bytestring.
Depend on bytestring-0.9.0.1 and provide a ByteString instance for IsString manually, in Text/Pandoc/ODT.hs.  Upgrading to 0.9.1.0 causes problems unless every package has been built with that version, so for now we stick with 0.9.0.1.
Simplified build process using template haskell. + Text/Pandoc/ASCIIMathML.hs, Text/Pandoc/DefaultHeaders.hs,   and Text/Pandoc/Writers/S5.hs are no longer built in Setup.hs   from templates in the templates/ directory. + Instead, they use template haskell to read data at compile   time from the relevant files in data/. + Setup.hs is back to the default simple configuration. + Removed old templates and Extra-Tmp-Files field from   pandoc.cabal.
Use minimum-sized (blank) content.xml in odt-styles.
Use template haskell to store reference.odt as blob in pandoc. + Added contentsOf to Text.Pandoc.Shared. + Use this to get contents of reference.odt at compile time in   Text.Pandoc.ODT + Added bytestring and template-haskell dependencies to pandoc.cabal.
Makefile: build reference.odt before configure.
Added note on utf8-string dependency to INSTALL.
Added utf8-string library to depends in debian/control.
Added code for xml library (Text.XML.Light) to source tree, since there is currently no debian package.  Removed dependency on xml library.  Added license to debian/copyright.
Compatibility fixes for CPP, Cabal, and haddock: + Use CPP in "Extensions" field in pandoc.cabal. + Removed use of backslash string continuations in source files.
Removed superfluous binary and bytestring dependencies in pandoc.cabal.
Setup.hs: Use simpleUserHooks rather than deprecated defaultUserHooks.
Use utf8-string's System.IO.UTF8 to replace Text.Pandoc.UTF8. + removed Text/Pandoc/UTF8.hs + removed UTF8.hs notice from debian/copyright + adjusted main.hs, Text/Pandoc.hs, and Text/Pandoc/ODT.hs to use   System.IO.UTF8 instead of Text.Pandoc.UTF8 + Added dependency on utf8-string to pandoc.cabal
Added 'library' and 'executable' configuration flags. Cabal can now be told to build just the library or just the executable. Updated INSTALL accordingly.
Added 'odt' output option to pandoc: Not a writer, but a module that inserts the output of the OpenDocument writer into an ODT archive.  This replaces markdown2odt.
OpenDocument writer:  don't print alt text with Image.
Fixed typo in pandoc.cabal.
Simplified Setup.hs by removing PostClean hooks. Added Extra-Tmp-Files to pandoc.cabal; this does the same thing.
Improved pandoc.cabal: + Added Extra-Source-Files so sdist contains everything needed to build + Added "Build-Type" field to avoid warning.
Code cleanup in Text/Pandoc/Highlighting.hs.
Use CPP to simplify build procedure for Highlighting.hs module. This is no longer built by Setup.hs in the pre-configure phase.
HTML writer: override Text.XHtml's stringToHtml function, so that characters below 0xff are not converted to numerical entity references. Also convert '\160' to "&nbsp;". This should aid readability and editability of the HTML source. It does presuppose that the HTML will be served as UTF-8.
Added MediaWiki writer.
Added mention of opendocument writer to pandoc man page.
Added OpenDocument format to cabal description.
Markdown reader: Parse setext headers before atx headers. Test case:    # hi    ==== parsed by Markdown.pl as an H1 header with contents "# hi".
HTML writer test: use UTF-8 characters rather than entities.
Fixed REFERENCEODT in markdown2odt to point to the right place in debian builds. Resolves Issue #79.
Added proper support for embedded images to opendocument writer.
Style fixes in opendocument writer: + tight definition lists + author/date styles + quotation spacing.
Modified content.xml and styles.xml for better appearance of ODT documents.
More work on smallcaps support. + Added to refsMatch in Shared. + Supported all writers to the extent possible.
Add preliminary support for SmallCaps inline element.  (Andrea Rossato)
Fixed bug in Markdown parser:  regular $s triggering math mode. For example:  "shoes ($20) and socks ($5)."
Commented out some unneeded code in HTML reader.
Code cleanup - RST reader.
Added type declarations to avoid -Wall 'defaulting' warnings in writers.
LaTeX reader - Code cleanup.

Code cleanup in Text.Pandoc.Blocks to eliminate -Wall warnings.
Code cleanup in HTML writer to eliminate -Wall warnings.
Code cleanup in LaTeX writer to eliminate -Wall warnings.
OpenDocument writer: Indented bulleted lists as we do enumerated lists.
Added distinction between tight and loose lists in OpenDocument writer. (For bullet and enumerated lists only.)
Fixed bugs in OpenDocument writer affecting nested block quotes.
Escape '\160' as "&#160;", not "&nbsp;" in XML. "nbsp" isn't a predefined XML entity.
Added paragraph to README about producing S5 with separate CSS/javascript.
Added type signatures and fixed other -Wall warnings in Markdown reader.
Added a few more recognized abbreviations to 'abbrev' parser.
Print unicode \160 literally in markdown writer, rather than as &nbsp;.
In smart mode, use nonbreaking spaces after abbreviations in markdown parser. Thus, for example, "Mr. Brown" comes out as "Mr.~Brown" in LaTeX, and does not produce a sentence-separating space.  Resolves Issue #75.
Treat '\ ' in (extended) markdown as nonbreaking space. Print nonbreaking space appropriately in each writer (e.g. ~ in LaTeX).
Added note to INSTALL that Cabal >= 1.2 is required for build. Resolves Issue #74.
Changed inDefinition and indentPara to stInDefinition and stIndentPara (for consistency).
Updated .gitignore to exclude README.Debian.
Added README.Debian documenting what the "Suggests" are needed for. Closes Debian bug #488642.
In HTML tests, use decimal entities for everything above 127. This is how xhtml-3000.2.0.0 works.
Added type signatures, etc., to eliminate -Wall warnings. (except for two warnings about unneeded functions, which might come in handy some day...)
Added -Wall to ghc-options in pandoc.cabal.
Cleaned up Text/Pandoc/CharacterReferences.hs to avoid -Wall warnings.
Cleaned up Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs to avoid -Wall warnings.
Cleaned up Main.hs to eliminate -Wall warnings.

OpenDocument writer: Fixed indentation for verbatim blocks inside defn lists.
OpenDocument writer:  Use different bullets for different list levels.
OpenDocument writer:  Return empty Doc in title block for null author, title, date.
OpenDocument writer: don't convert 4 spaces to tab in verbatim block.
Use \textsubscr instead of \textsubscript for LaTeX subscript macro. \textsubscript conflicts with a definition in the memoir class. Resolves Issue #65.
Markdown smart typography: Em dashes no longer eat surrounding whitespace. Resolves Issue #69.
Removed whitespace before newlines in macports portfile template.
HTML writer:  In code blocks, change leading newlines to <br /> tags. (Some browsers ignore them.)  Resolves Issue #71. See http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2008-May/001297.html
Count anything that isn't a known block (HTML) tag as an inline tag (rather than the other way around).  Added "html", "head", and "body" to list of block tags.  Resolves Issue #66, allowing <lj> to count as an inline tag.
Fixed haddock documentation error (affects latest version of haddock only).
Fixed bug in RTF writer: Extra spaces were being printed after emphasized, boldface, and other inline elements.  Resolves Issue #64.
Additional README changes for OpenDocument writer.
Added link to OpenDocument XML in web page.
Documented OpenDocument writer and markdown2odt in website.
Documented OpenDocument writer in macports Portfile.
Documented OpenDocument writer and markdown2odt in freebsd pkg-descr.
Documented OpenDocument writer and markdown2odt in debian/control.
Documented OpenDocument writer and markdown2odt in README. Folded "Requirements" section into description of shell scripts.
Changed name of output file in web demo #21.
The '--sanitize-html' option now examines URIs in markdown links and images, and in HTML href and src attributes.  If the URI scheme is not on a whitelist of safe schemes, it is rejected.  The main point is to prevent cross-site scripting attacks using 'javascript:' URIs. See http://www.mail-archive.com/markdown-discuss@six.pairlist.net/msg01186.html and http://ha.ckers.org/xss.html.  Resolves Issue #62.
Fixed handling of Quoted inline elements to use unicode left & right quotes. Added inQuotes auxiliary function.
Added demos for opendocument XML and markdown2odt.
Added preliminary version of markdown2odt wrapper. Added man page. Modified Makefile to create markdown2odt from template. Modified Makefile to create reference.odt file from files in odt-styles. Modified Makefile to install reference.odt into PACKAGEDATAPATH. Modified macports Portfile. Modified freebsd Makefile.
Added odt-styles directory with default ODT styles.
Acknowledge contributors in README.
OpenDocument: use the new Definition_20_Term and Definition_20_Definition styles and some other minor cleanup.
Code cleanup only.
OpenDocument writer:  Don't print raw HTML. (Note: For the DocBook writer, it makes sense to pass through HTML raw, since the "HTML" might be DocBook XML.  But this isn't desirable for the OpenDocument writer, it seems to me.)
Moved XML-formatting functions to new unexported module Text.Pandoc.XML.
Andrea Rossato's patch for OpenDocument support.
Small fix to markdown2pdf man page: only input needs to be piped through iconv.
Added .gitignore.
Added amsmath package to default LaTeX header. Resolves Issue #48.
Require parsec < 3. The compatibility module in parsec 3.0.0 gives far worse performance than parsec 2.1.  Eventually pandoc will be upgraded to use the new bytestring version of parsec, and then we'll go to parsec 3.0.0.
Added Texinfo writer to exported modules in pandoc.cabal.
Modified disallowedInNode in Texinfo writer to correct list of disallowed characters.
Use style attributes rather than css classes for strikethrough and ordered list styles. This works better when fragments, rather than standalone documents, are generated.
Changes to Texinfo writer: + No space between paragraph and following @verbatim (provides more   pleasing appearance in text formats) + Blank line consistently after list environments. + Removed deVerb. + Use @code instead of @verb for inline code (this solves the character   escaping problem for texi2dvi and texi2pdf). + Modified test suite accordingly. + Added Peter Wang to copyright statement (for Texinfo.hs). + Added news of Texinfo writer to README. + Added Texinfo to list of formats in man page, and removed extra 'groff'. + Updated macports with Texinfo format. + Updated FreeBSD pkg-descr with Texinfo format. + Updated web page with Texinfo writer. + Added demos for Texinfo writer. + Added Texinfo to package description in debian/control. + Added texi & texinfo extensions to Main.hs, and fixed bug in determining   default output extension. + Changed from texinfo to texi extension in web demo.
Committed novalazy's initial patch for texinfo output, including tests for texinfo writer.
Moved BlockWrapper and wrappedBlocksToDoc from ConTeXt writer to Shared.
Fixed path for library documentation in website.
Updated package URL for pandoc.cabal and pandoc.cabal.ghc66. Updated pandoc.cabal.ghc66 with highlighting modules and new location for DefaultWriters.
Removed font-size 110% on code in web css.
Renamed web/code.txt -> code.text. Deleted code.text from top-level directory.
Minor changes due to changes in highlighting-kate API. defaultHighlightingCss now imported rather than duplicated.
Makefile:  Add files in templates directory as dependencies for $(BUILDCONF).
Added note about syntax highlighting to "Features" on web page.
Support for startFrom="nn" to select starting line number in syntax highlighting. Changed argument of highlightHtml to Attr, not [String], for generality.
Remove build dependencies on libghc6-regex-compat-dev, libghc6-uulib-dev and perl.
Renamed default headers with .header extension; have Setup.hs look for these. (This fixes a bug where Setup.hs would find .svn directories.)
Mark the package as UNRELEASED.
Moved code.txt -> code.text.
Revert "Added note in INSTALL about doing 'make templates' if installing using Cabal from svn."
Have --version print a list of supported languages for syntax highlighting.
Updated README's instructions on delimited code blocks to include information about syntax highlighting.
Added website demo for code highlighting.
Updated INSTALL with instructions for compiling in syntax highlighting support.
CABALOPTS may now be specified with 'make'. For example:  CABALOPTS=-fhighlighting make
Added build option for syntax highlighting, with *optional* dependency on highlighting-kate. + pandoc.cabal includes a flag, 'highlighting', that causes a dependency   on highlighting-kate. + if Setup.hs detects this dependency, it copies templates/Highlighting.yes.hs   to Text/Pandoc/Highlighting.hs.  Otherwise, it copies templates/Highlighting.no.hs. + The HTML writer imports this new module instead of Text.Highlighting.Kate.   The new module exports highlightHtml, which either uses highlighting-kate to   perform syntax highlighting or automatically returns a failure code, depending   on whether highlighting support was selected. + --version now prints information about whether syntax highlighting support is compiled in.
Modified Setup.hs with new location for DefaultHeaders.hs. Print template notice on top of autogenerated source files.
Removed Text.Regex dependencies by rewriting using plain Haskell: + from Text.Pandoc.Writers.RTF + from Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML + from Main + from pandoc.cabal
Moved Text.Pandoc.Writers.DefaultHeaders -> Text.Pandoc.DefaultHeaders.
Makefile:  only use --with-hc-pkg if GHC_PKG is defined. Note that Cabal will automatically choose the ghc-pkg appropriate for the compiler selected, so normally specifying GHC by itself is sufficient.
Incorporated templates phase into Setup.hs and improved templates. + Removed templates/Makefile and fillTemplates.pl. + Removed 'templates' Makefile target. + Added postConf hook to Setup.hs that fills the templates. + Use compressed javascripts for S5 and ASCIIMathML templates. + Revised test suite.
Add default CSS to document header if syntax highlighting used.
Added code.txt to web/ for demos.
Added preliminary support for syntax highlighting to HTML writer.
Included highlighting-kate in build-depends.
Factored codeBlock into separate codeBlockIndented and codeBlockDelimited. Do not use codeBlockDelimited in strict mode.
Updated test suite to new baseline (but no tests yet for new code block syntax).
Use generic attributes type, not a string, for CodeBlocks.
Documentation for delimited code blocks.
Put language class information in pre tag, not code tag, in HTML code blocks.
Fixed delimited code blocks:  eat blank lines afterwards, and allow end line to contain more tildes than beginning line.
Added a needed try to {} attribute parser.
Added support for multiple classes in delimited code block.
Initial support for delimited code blocks in markdown reader.
HTML writer:  if language specified for code block, print as <code> class.
Modified tests for new argument in CodeBlock.
Modified writers for new argument place in CodeBlock.
Modified readers for new parameter in CodeBlock.
Added parameter for class to CodeBlock (for syntax highlighting).
* Debian packaging changes:
Added note in INSTALL about doing 'make templates' if installing using Cabal from svn.
Added \setupitemize[autointro] to ConTeXt header, to prevent orphaned list introduction lines.
website: Added math.text to dependencies for examples.html in Makefile.
Moved math.txt -> math.text on web page, so it won't be confused with page source.
Changed names of HTML man pages to *.1.html on website.
Fixed bug in RST reader, which would choke on: "p. one\ntwo\n". Added some try's in ordered list parsers.
Updated INSTALL with instructions for getting GHC + libraries using apt-get.
Removed unnecessary imports.
Added Arch linux instructions to INSTALL.
Bumped version to 0.47.
Made -c/--css option repeatable on the command line (like -H, -A, -B). Documented repeatability of these options in README.
Updated website with news of version 0.46 release.
Added some details to RELEASE-CHECKLIST.
Removed redundant DISTNAME field from freebsd Makefile template.
Changed copyright dates where appropriate to include 2008.
Changed dates on documentation.
Removed unneeded link reference from website index.txt.in.
Changed comment used to replace unsafe HTML if sanitize-html option selected.
* Debian packaging changes:
Updated changelog.
RST reader: Fixed bug in parsing explicit links (resolves Issue #44). The problem was that we were looking for inlines until a '<' character signaled the start of the URL.  So if you hit a reference-style link, it would keep looking til the end of the document.  Fix:  change inline => (notFollowedBy (char '`') >> inline).  Note that this won't allow code inlines in links, but these aren't allowed in resT anyway.
RST reader:  cleaned up parsing of reference names in key blocks and links. Allow nonquoted reference links to contain isolated '.', '-', '_', so so that strings like 'a_b_' count as links.
RST reader: Removed unnecessary check for following link in str. This is unnecessary now that link is above str in the definition of 'inline'.
Fixed markdown reader to handle "*hi **there***" as a strong nested in an emph. (A '*' is only recognized as the end of the emphasis if it's not the beginning of a strong emphasis.)
Markdown reader: Moved blockQuote parser before list parsers.
Added RELEASE-CHECKLIST.
Use an interpreted text role to render math in restructuredText. See http://www.american.edu/econ/itex2mml/mathhack.rst for the strategy.
Refactored RST writer to usea record instead of a tuple for state, and to include options in state so it doesn't need to be passed as a parameter.
Added optional HTML sanitization using a whitelist. When this option is specified (--sanitize-html on the command line), unsafe HTML tags will be replaced by HTML comments, and unsafe HTML attributes will be removed.  This option should be especially useful for those who want to use pandoc libraries in web applications, where users will provide the input.
Made -H, -A, and -B cumulative:  if they are specified multiple times, multiple files will be included.
Fixed bug in the markdown reader:  HTML preceding a code block could cause it to be parsed as a paragraph.  (The problem is that the HTML parser used to eat all blank space after an HTML block, including the indentation of the code block.)  Resolves Issue #39. + In Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML, removed parsing of following space   from rawHtmlBlock. + In Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown, modified rawHtmlBlocks so that   indentation is eaten *only* on the first line after the HTML   block.  This means that in   <div>        foo   <div>   the foo won't be treated as a code block, but in   <div>
HTML reader:  Finished fixing Issue #40. Contents of script tags were still being treated as markdown when the script tags were parsed as inline.  Fixed by moving "script" from the list of tags that can be either block or inline to the list of block tags.
HTML reader: Don't interpret contents of style tags as markdown. Resolves Issue #40. + Added htmlStyle, analagous to htmlScript. + Use htmlStyle in htmlBlockElement and rawHtmlInline.
Fixed bug in HTML reader:  it was looking for <IT> tag, not <I>.
Made LaTeX reader properly recognize --parse-raw in rawLaTeXInline. Updated LaTeX reader test to use --parse-raw.
Changed handling of titles in HTML writer so you don't get "titleprefix - " followed by nothing.
Use wrappers around Doc elements to ensure proper spacing in ConTeXt writer. Each block element is wrapped with either Pad or Reg.  Pad'ed elements are guaranteed to have a blank line in between.  Updated ConTeXt tests.
Markdown reader:  Make 'block' conditional on strictness state, instead of using failIfStrict in block parsers. Use a different ordering of parsers in strict mode: raw HTML block before paragraph. This recovers performance that was lost in strict mode with r1154.
Markdown: better handling of parentheses in URLs and quotation marks in titles. + source parser first tries to parse URL with balanced parentheses;   if that doesn't work, it tries to parse everything beginning with   '(' and ending with ')'. + source parser now uses an auxiliary function source'. + linkTitle parser simplified and improved, under assumption that it   will be called in context of source'.
Modified markdown reader to disallow links within links. (Resolves Issue #35.) + Replaced inlinesInBalanced with inlinesInBalancedBrackets, which instead   of hard-coding the inline parser takes an inline parser as a parameter. + Modified reference and inlineNote to use inlinesInBalancedBrackets. + Removed unneeded inlineString function. + Added inlineNonLink parser, which is now used in the definition of   reference. + Added inlineParsers list and redefined inline and inlineNonLink parsers   in terms of it. + Added failIfLink parser.
Improved handling of raw HTML in Markdown reader.  (Resolves Issue #36.) Tags that can be either block or inline (e.g. <ins>) should be treated as block when appropriate and as inline when appropriate.  Thus, for example,   <ins>hi</ins> should be treated as a paragraph with inline <ins> tags, while   <ins>
Changed failure message in anyHtmlBlockTag (minor change).
Modified rawHtmlBlock in HTML reader so it parses </html> and </body> tags. This allows these tags to be handled correctly in Markdown. HTML reader now uses rawHtmlBlock', which excludes </html> and </body>, since these are handled in parseHtml.  (Resolves Issue #38.)
Modified 'source' parser in Markdown reader to allow backslash escapes in URLs. So, for example, [my](/url\(1\)) yields a link to /url(1).  Resolves Issue #34.
Modified rules for HTML header identifiers to ensure legal identifiers. + Modified htmlListToIdentifier and uniqueIdentifier in HTML writer   to ensure that identifiers begin with an alphabetic character. + The new rules are described in README. + Resolves Issue #33.
Fixed handling of email addresses in markdown and reStructuredText. Consolidated uri and email address parsers.  (Resolves Issue #37.) + New emailAddress and uri parsers in Text.Pandoc.Shared.   uri parser uses parseURI from Network.URI.  emailAddress   parser properly handles email addresses with periods in them. + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.RST. + Removed uri and emailAddress parsers from Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown.
Bumped version number to 0.46.
Added date to release note on website.
Use \{0,1\} instead of \? in sed, so it works on BSD/Mac OSX too.
Updated website.
Makefile website target:  create changelog.txt, not changelog. This ensures that browsers will treat it as text.
Removed support for "box-style" block quotes in markdown. This adds unneeded complexity and makes pandoc diverge further than necessary from other markdown extensions. Brought documentation, tests, and debian/changelog up to date.
Updated debian/changelog.
Added new HTML math demos to website.  Revamped mkdemos.pl for simplicity.
Adjusted test suite for footnote changes in LaTeX and ConTeXt writers.
Improvements to LaTeX and ConTeXt footnote handling: + ConTeXt:  } at end of footnote now occurs on a new line when the   footnote ends with \stoptyping, just as in LaTeX writer. + LaTeX and ConTeXt:  \footnote is no longer indented.  The indentation   causes problems with wrapping, as it makes the line too long.
If gladtex specified, don't prettyprint <EQ> tags, or gladtex gets confused.
Small fix to error handling in TeXMath parser:
Removed note about public mimetex server from README.
Updated test suite -- no italics for digits.
TeXMath parser:  use emphasis only for letters, not numbers.
Updated HTML and S5 writer tests for new span tags in math.
Put math in HTML inside <span class="math">. This way it can be distinguished from the surrounding text, e.g. put in a different font.  Updated README accordingly.
Added Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath and changed default handling of math. + Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath exports readTeXMath, which reads raw TeX   math and outputs a string of pandoc inlines that tries to render it   as far as possible, lapsing into literal TeX when needed. + Added Text.Pandoc.Readers.TeXMath to pandoc.cabal + ghc66 version. + Modified writers so that readTeXMath is used for default HTMl output   in HTML, S5, RTF, Docbook. + Updated README with information about how math is rendered in all formats. + Updated test suite.
Website: Added note about inclusion in Ubuntu Hardy Heron.
Removed TODO.
Updated tests with new way of displaying math in HTML (with no enclosing $'s).
Added --gladtex and --mimetex options. + New HTMLMathMethod structure in WriterOptions keeps track of how to   display math in HTML output. + If none of the special options are selected, default to displaying   TeX math verbatim, with no enclosing $'s, in HTML.
Documented new --gladtex and --mimetex options, and new treatment of TeX math.
Added HTMLMathMethod writer option. This selects between asciimathml, mimetex, gladtex, and plain math.
Modified s5 fancy test to include new ASCIIMathML.js.
Small change to wording in README.
New version of ASCIIMathML.js.
Modified writer tests for new Math and TeX output.
Changed all writers to handle new Math block element. This allows TeX element to be handled differently (and in many output formats, simply ignored).
Revised s5.native test with Math block.
Fixed small error in testsuite.native.
Modified markdown reader for new Math block.
Modified LaTeX reader for new Math blocks.
Modified refsMatch for new Math block element.
Added new Math block element.
Changed tests to use new Math block element.
Added TODO for math branch notes.
Removed src, headers, ui from top-level -- git-svn didn't do this.
Makefile changes:  BUILDCONF and CABAL_BKP. + Changed BUILDCONF to point to dist/setup-config, not .setup-config.   This is where current versions of Cabal put it.  'make clean' works again! + Do not clean up CABAL_BKP, because it might need to be recovered for   a new build with a different GHC version.
Small improvements in Makefile: + Added $(BUILDCMD) target, so setup doesn't get compiled every time. + Removed (now circular) dependency of templates on ./templates.
Moved ASCIIMathML.js, headers, and ui into templates. Adjusted templates/Makefile and fillTemplates.pl as needed.
Changed references to source directory in Makefile and pandoc.cabal.*.
Moved everything from src into the top-level directory.
Removed Text directory.  This is a remnant of an experiment moving the contents of src/ to the top level, and should have been deleted long ago.
Makefile:  Add .exe extension to BUILDCMD if building on Windows.
+ Makefile now checks GHC version.  If GHC is 6.6, pandoc.cabal.ghc66   is copied to pandoc.cabal, and the old pandoc.cabal is copied to   pandoc.cabal.orig.  Otherwise, pandoc.cabal is copied to pandoc.cabal.orig   but otherwise unmodified.  This way, the Makefile will work properly   with either GHC 6.6 or 6.8. + The changes in debian/rules from r1066 have been reverted, since they   are no longer needed.  Also, debian/rules has been converted to UTF-8. + INSTALL instructions have been updated accordingly.
Updated debian/changelog.
Reverted changes in r1086 (implicit section header references). This caused too much of a performance hit.
Improved and simplified setextHeader parser in markdown reader.
Updated PROFILING instructions.  It is no longer necessary to insert -auto-all by hand, since Ghc-Prof-Options takes care of that.
Use Ghc-Prof-Options to ensure that '-auto-all' is used when '--enable-*-profiling' is specified.
Improved efficiency of romanNumeral parser (in Text.Pandoc.Shared) for a big speed boost in (non-strict) markdown parsing.
Changes to testsuite for new \useURL in context writer.
+ Changed \useurl to \useURL in ConTeXt output. + Changed links from red to blue in ConTeXt output.
Implemented implicit reference-style links to section headers in markdown. For example, if you have a header '# Supported architectures', you can link to it with '[Supported architectures]'.  If there are multiple headers with this label, the link will point to the first of them. Implicit references are always overridden by explicitly specified references. Addresses Issue #20.
Fixed some haddock documentation bugs in Shared.hs.
More improvements to ConTeXt writer: + writer options are now in state, so they don't have to be passed as   a parameter + state also keeps track of ordered list level, so the right default   numbering scheme can be used + extra blank line after \stopitemize + removed definitions of ltxenum and ltxitem from the preamble + both kinds of lists are now generated using \start-stopitemize, with   appropriate options + in the case of bulleted lists, no options need be specified, because   defaults are given in the preamble + test suite updated accordingly
ConTeXt writer: + Don't use \(sub)+subject if header level > 5. + Modified tests to conform to new treatment of level 4 and 5 headers.
Modified ConTeXt writer to use \subsubsubsubsection etc., since these are supported (up to at least sub x 5).
Use $(GHC) instead of ghc and make them user configurable through environment to support unusual ghc installations, for example:
Adjusted formatting of LaTeX and ConTeXt footnotes: - in ConTeXt, % is not needed at end of line before note, since   space is gobbled. - beginning of footnote indented four spaces. - this required an additional parameter in wrappedTeX and   wrapTeXIfNeeded, in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
ConTeXt writer:  Use itemize options, not sym{}, to produce ordered lists with custom numbering styles.
New, "official" definition of blockquote environment in ConTeXt header. Also, use blank line after \startblockquote to balance blank line at the end.
Fixed logic in markdown smart quote parsing: + Added some needed 'try' statements. + Unicode right single-quote can double as apostrophe, so treat it   as a quote-end only when not followed by an alphanumeric character.
Fixed smart quote parsing in markdown reader so that unicode characters 8216 and 8217 are recognized as single quotes, and 8220 and 8221 as double quotes.
Updated documentation to reflect the fact that LaTeX and ConTeXt writers now wrap text by default.
Updated tests for changes in LaTeX and ConTeXt writers.
Changes to ConTeXt writer: + PrettyPrint module now used for output. + Text wrapping now provided, using wrapTeXIfNeeded. + Better treatment of footnotes:  footnotes are always on lines by themselves. + Use \subject, \subsubject, ... or \section, \subsection, ... for headings,   depending on whether --number-sections option is selected.
Improved footnote handling in LaTeX writer: + use wrapTeXIfNeeded instead of wrapIfNeeded + make sure footnotes occur on lines by themselves, with a % at the   end of the preceding line to prevent unwanted spaces + added writer options to state, so it can be accessed by wrapTeXIfNeeded
Added wrappedTeX and wrapTeXIfNeeded functions to Text.Pandoc.Shared. These ensure that footnotes occur on lines by themselves (to make them easier to move around), and that they don't screw up text wrapping.
Modified debian/changelog -- include last bugfix.
Fixed bug in LaTeX reader (pointed out by Mark Eli Kalderon): needed a "try" before "string" in parser for \[ math blocks.
Remove a duplicate comment line.
Modified build procedure to allow compilation with GHC 6.8: + pandoc.cabal now uses Cabal configurations and requires Cabal >=1.2. + An alternative pandoc.cabal.ghc66 is provided for those who have older   versions of Cabal. + Debian build process has been modified to use pandoc.cabal.ghc66,   as a temporary measure until GHC 6.8 gets into debian unstable. + INSTALL instructions have been updated. + Makefile has been updated to accommodate changes in pandoc.cabal. + pandoc.cabal.ghc68 has been removed, since the default version now   works with GHC 6.8.
Added a version of pandoc.cabal that works with GHC 6.8.1.
Reverted back to state as of r1062.  The template haskell changes are more trouble than they're worth.
Use template haskell to avoid the need for templates: + Added library Text.Pandoc.Include, with a template haskell   function $(includeStrFrom fname) to include a file as a string   constant at compile time. + This removes the need for the 'templates' directory or Makefile   target.  These have been removed. + The base source directory has been changed from src to . + A new 'data' directory has been added, containing the ASCIIMathML.js   script, writer headers, and S5 files. + The src/wrappers directory has been moved to 'wrappers'. + The Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML library is no longer needed, since   Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML can use includeStrFrom to include the   ASCIIMathML.js code directly.  It has been removed.
Updated changelog in light of last change.
Cleaned up LaTeX footnotes: + Footnotes start on a separate line.  A comment % is used   at the end of the previous line to prevent unwanted spaces.   This makes footnotes easier to see, delete, and move around. + The final } now only appears on a separate line if it needs to   (i.e. if the note ends with a Verbatim environment).
Fixed bug in parsing files that begin with blank lines. + In Text.Pandoc.Shared: rewrote lineClump to parse EITHER a string   of blank lines OR a string of nonblanks.  Removed code for parsing   eof. + In Markdown and RST readers, use 'manyTill (... <|> lineClump) eof'   instead of many, since lineClump no longer parses eof.
Modified specialChar in LaTeX reader so that '"' characters are parsed and do not cause an error.
Updated changelog to reflect change to fromUTF8.
Modified fromUTF8 to strip out the BOM (byte order marker) wherever it is present.  See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte_Order_Mark and http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2007-October/000874.html.
'--no-wrap' option now prevents the addition of structural whitespace in HTML output, minimizing the file size.
Removed 'version' constant from Main.hs; added 'pandocVersion' to Text.Pandoc. This way all programs that use pandoc libraries will have access to the version number.
Updated changelog.
Improvements to RST reader: + Allow field lists to be indented. + Parse the contents of field lists instead of treating them as   raw strings. + Represent field lists as definition lists rather than blockquotes. + Fixed bug in which metadata would be overridden if the document   contained more than one field list. + Parse fields associated with ..image: blocks, and use the 'alt'   field, if present, for image alt text and title.
Save and restore position in parseFromString, so that it doesn't mess up accurate error location reporting.
Undid last change:  instead of blocking the internal links in the writers, it makes more sense to block them in the HTML reader.
Man writer:  Don't print link source for internal links (#...).
Fixed bug in RST reader:  previously, code blocks had to be indented a full tabstop, but RST allows any amount of indentation. Resolves Issue #27.
Makefile:
Changes in debian/changelog:
Changes in Makefile:
Updated debian/changelog.
New MacPorts Portfile template.  Installs pandoc programs and libraries. Note that 'make install-all' cannot be used to install the libraries, because registration must be done after the files are copied out of the destroot.  So a custom install procedure is included in the Portfile.
Added libghc6-network-dev, libghc6-xhtml-dev, and libghc6-mtl-dev as dependencies for libghc6-pandoc-dev.  Addresses Debian Bug #445235.
Modified html2markdown. Previously html2markdown piped all input through html tidy before passing it to pandoc.  This causes problems on certain sites (e.g. daringfireball.com/markdown) which have well-formed xhtml that causes tidy to choke.  Solution is to try pandoc on the original HTML, and run it through tidy only if that fails.
Add default value for URL in html2x.txt.
Added link to /pandoc/try on web page.
Fixed bug in markdown writer:  If an ordered list item began with a marker greater than 3 characters in width, and the item took more than one line, it would appear on the line after the list marker, e.g.:
Documented '--no-wrap' option in README and man pages.
Added a writer option for wrapped text and a command-line option '--no-wrap', which disables text wrapping.  (Resolves Issue #26.)
Changed ref to MacPorts to point to the MacPorts DB entry for pandoc.
Fixed a bug in the Markdown writer:  incorrect line wrapping in paragraphs including hard line breaks.  Resolves Issue #25.
Updated html2x.txt to reflect new location of script (in /cgi-bin instead of /pandoc).
Removed html2x.pl -- it belongs in its own repository.
RST writer:  If label for a link reference contains a colon, surround by ` signs so the colon won't be interpreted as the end of the link label.
Fixed macports Portfile: + Do installation manually rather than using Makefile's install-all.   (There appears to be a problem with the Makefile's handling of   DESTDIR.) + Note that the library must be registered in the activate phase, after   the library files have been copied out of the destroot.  Cabal   generates a 'register.sh' script that will do this.
Main (tabFilter): Treat '\r' at end of line as newline (in addition to '\r\n' and '\n').
Markdown writer:  Don't print title attribute if title is empty. (This differs from the behavior of Markdown.pl, and agrees with PHP Markdown.  But John Gruber has indicated that he prefers this behavior.) Adjusted test suite accordingly.
Markdown reader:  require space before title in links and references. This fixes a bug in parsing URLs like http://silly/url(withparen).
Modified html2x.pl URL validation regex: + allow port number in URL + allow : in URL path
Remove just one leading and one trailing newline from contents of <pre>...</pre> in codeBlock parser.
Changed parsing of code blocks in HTML reader: + <code> tag is no longer needed.  <pre> suffices. + all HTML tags in the code block (e.g. for syntax highlighting)   are skipped, because they are not portable to other output formats.
Modified html2x webpage.
Added Google analytics tracking to website.
Fixed URL regex in html2x.pl, and added a command to the pipe to truncate input pages to 100K.
Added security measures to html2x.pl.
Added html2x demo to the website.
Simplified HTML attribute parsing (HTML reader).
Fixed two bugs in HTML reader: + <code>...</code> not surrounded by <pre> should count as   inline HTML, not code block. + parser for minimized attributes should not swallow trailing spaces
Changed pandoc home page to http://johnmacfarlane.net/pandoc/.
+ Fixed bug in RST writer's handling of ordered lists.  Previously,   list items with multiple lines would not always line up with single-line   list items.  Now, list items are nested the length of the list marker + 1.   This looks better and ensures that list items all line up.  (Note that   list markers are padded to the length of the longest list marker in the   series.) + Use 3-space indent for unordered lists.
Simplified parsing of reference keys and notes in markdown and RST readers: + The Reference data structure from Text.Pandoc.Shared is no longer   needed, since + referenceKey and noteBlock parses return strings (as many blank lines   as are occuried by the key or note) and update state themselves. + getPosition and setPosition are now used to ensure that error messages   will give the correct line number. + This yields cleaner (and slightly faster) code, with more accurate   parsing error messages.
HTML writer:  Don't produce HTML for table of contents if there are no headers.  (This would be an empty list, which is invalid XHTML.)
Bumped version to 0.45.
Updated website with news of 0.43.
Updated debian/changelog.
No need to add $(BUILDDIR) and $(BUILDCONF) to cleanup_files, because they are removed automatically by '$(BUILDCMD) clean'.
* The previous fix was wrong.  Apply a proper fix and cross the fingers. :-)   + On configure, compile 'Setup.hs' to 'setup' and use 'setup' as the build     command instead of 'runhaskell', which, on some platforms (such as s390,     alpha, m68k), throws the following error:     	runhaskell Setup.hs configure --prefix=/usr 	ghc-6.6.1: not built for interactive use     This causes a serious FTBFS bug.  Closes: #440668 (from Debian BTS).   + Setup.hs: revert changes.
* Urgent fix to address the following issue:   	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=440668   The below link of a similar bug explains things a bit more: 	http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=431843#22
Added xmlns attribute to html element in html writer tests. This attribute is added by more recent versions of the xhtml library, including the one that comes with GHC 6.6.1.
Changed link to Arch PKGBUILD script on website.
Bump version numbers to 0.44, which will be the next bug-fix release (when enough bug fixes have accumulated).
HTML writer:  put anchors around contents of headers, not around the header tags themselves, when producing backlinks to TOC. Resolves Issue #23.
Fixed CSS for website so headers linked back to TOC don't have lines under them.
Added note about Arch linux PKGBUILD script.
Small changes in website.
Removed files no longer needed in website: + pandocwiki tarball + highlight.css
Fixed formatting mistakes in 0.43 news on website.
Added link to google code svn repository for pandocwiki, instead of tarball.
Added '-font monospace' to highlight command, so wretched courier new won't be used in highlighted HTML and LaTeX in demos.
* debian/changelog: add signature
Updated website with news of 0.43...
Updated debian/changelog.
Markdown writer:  escape paragraphs that begin with ordered list markers, so they don't get interpreted as ordered lists.
LaTeX command and environment names can't contain numbers. LaTeX reader updated accordingly.
Added separate latex reader and native reader tests; removed round-trip tests.
Skip notes parsing if running in strict mode.  (This yields a nice speed improvement in strict mode.)
Simplify autolink parsing code, using Network.URI to test for URIs.  Added dependency on network library to debian/control and pandoc.cabal.
More perspicuous definition of nonindentSpaces.
Removed unneeded 'try' in 'rawLine'.
Combined linebreak and whitespace into a new whitespace parser, to avoid unnecessary reparsing of space characters.
Removed unnecessary 'try' in 'codeBlock'.
Use lookAhead in parsers for setext headers and definition lists to see if the next line begins appropriately; if not, don't waste any more time parsing...
Don't require blank lines after code block.  (It's sufficient to end code block with a nonindented line.)
Changed definition of 'emph':  italics with '_' must not be followed by an alphanumeric character.  This is to help prevent interpretation of e.g. [LC_TYPE]: my_type as '[LC<em>TYPE]:my</em>type'.
Makefile: Get VERSION from cabal file, not Main.hs.
Cleanup up Text.Pandoc.Shared to eliminate warnings when compiling with -Wall.
Modified MacPorts Portfile: + depend on haddock + build and install libraries and library documentation   in addition to the executable
Replaced individual wrapping routines in RST, Man, and Markdown writers with 'wrapped' from Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Removed extra blank lines at end of LaTeX writer tests.
Added 'wrapped' function to Text.Pandoc.Shared. This helps wrap text into paragraphs, using the prettyprinting library.
Rewrote LaTeX writer to use the prettyprinting library, so we get word wrapping, etc.
Modified latex writer tests for new latex writer using prettyprinter.
Version bump to 0.43.
Fixed bug in LaTeX reader, which wrongly assumed that the roman numeral after "enum" in "setcounter" would consist entirely of "i"s.  enumiv is legitimate.
Cleaned up LaTeX reader. Rearranged order of parsers in inline for slight speed improvement. Added ` to special characters and 'unescapedChar'.
Removed unneeded try's in RST reader; also minor code cleanup.
Efficiency improvements to RST reader (more than doubled speed): + removed tabchar + rearranged parsers in inline
Purely stylistic change.
Removed unneeded 'try' in 'ellipses'.
+ Fixed bug introduced into referenceTitle by previous changes.   Now it works as before. + Improved Markdown.pl-compatibility in referenceLink:  the two   parts of a reference-style link may be separated by one space,   but not more... [a] [link], [not]   [a link].
Fixed markdown inline code parsing so it better accords with Markdown.pl:  the marker for the end of the code section is a clump of the same number of `'s with which the section began, followed by a non-` character.  So, for example,
Small change to referenceTitle:  should end with line-end, not ')'.
Split 'title' into 'linkTitle' and 'referenceTitle', since the rules are slightly different.
Rewrote charsInBalanced and charsInBalanced'. - Documented restriction: open and close must be distinct characters. - Rearranged options for greater efficiency. - Changed inner call to charsInBalanced inside charsInBalanced' to   charsInBalanced'.
Removed unneeded 'try' from noteMarker.
Minor reformatting.
Rewrote 'para' for greater efficiency.
Fixed bug in LaTeX writer:  autolinks would not cause '\usepackage{url}' to be put in the document header. Also, changes to state in enumerated list items would be overwritten.
Minor reformatting.
Rewrote link parsers for greater efficiency.
anyLine now requires that the line end with a newline (not eof). This is a harmless assumption, since we always add newlines to the end of a block before parsing with anyLine. Yields a 10% speed boost!
Main: Replaced tabsToSpacesInLine and tabFilter with single function tabFilter, which operates on the whole string rather than breaking it into lines.
+ Removed tabsToSpaces and tabsInLine from Text.Pandoc.Shared.   (They were used only in Main.) + Wrote new tabsToSpacesInLine function in Main that changes tabs   to spaces and removes DOS line-endings in one pass, for a slight   speed improvement.
Removed redundant 'referenceLink' in definition of inline (it's already in 'link').
Refactored escapeChar so it doesn't need 'try'.
Removed unneeded 'try' in multilineRow.
Removed unneeded 'try' in dashedLine.
Removed unneeded try in rawHtmlBlocks (Markdown parser).
Refactored hrule for performance in Markdown reader.
Minor reformatting.
Refactored setext header parsing in Markdown reader for greater speed.
More rearranging in definition of inline.
More intelligent rearranging of 'inline' for speed boosts in Text.Pandoc.Readers.Markdown.
Removed unneeded 'try' from romanNumeral parser.
Use notFollowedBy instead of notFollowedBy' in charsInBalanced.
Removed unneeded 'try' in 'parseFromString'.
Removed unneeded 'try' from stringAnyCase.  (Now it behaves like 'string'.)
Changed definition of 'enclosed' in Text.Pandoc.Shared so that 'try' is not automatically applied to the 'end' parser. Added 'try' in calls to 'enclosed' where needed.  Slight speed increase.
Minor code cleanup in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Performance improvements: + Rearranged parsers in definition of 'inline' so that the most frequently used would (by and large) be tried first. + Removed some unneeded 'try's. + Removed tabchar parser, as whitespace handles tabs anyway. + All in all, these changes, together with the last two commits,   cut almost in half the time it takes pandoc to parse a large test file.
Removed unnecessary 'try' in 'anyLine' (Text.Pandoc.Shared).
Refactored Text.Pandoc.CharacterReferences. Removed unnecessary 'try's for a speed improvement. Removed unnecessary '&' and ';' from the entity table.
Added template item for md5 sum in Portfile.in.
Updated Portfile.in to match the version in the MacPorts repository (r28278 in MacPorts).
Removed local references to Portfile, since pandoc is now in the MacPorts repository.  Updated INSTALL instructions and website.
Changed link to README to README.html.
* changelog: make sure to close pandoc's ITP bug.
Added note that Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML was exposed to 0.42 "News".
Don't try to generate distinfo in Makefile.  Make this using 'make makesum' in freebsd instead.
Added note about 'yourusername' in MacPorts section.
Small change to website -> "Installation instructions" not "installing from source."
Make freeebsd and macports targets depend on tarball.
Added News for 0.42 release to website.
Added Cabal installation method to INSTALL.
Added pandocwiki demo to website.
Updated changelog.
Removed osx-package specific files, and references to them in Makefiles.
Removed osx package targets in Makefile, and documentation for them in INSTALL.  osx packaging was not working well, because of the binary's dependency on a dynamic library GMP.  A MacPorts port will be provided instead.
Changes to website for new installation instructions. Removed OSX package.
Updated INSTALL instructions.
Updated debian/changelog.
Re-exposed Text.Pandoc.ASCIIMathML.  We need it in Text.Pandoc.Readers.HTML.
Don't count     p. 27 at the beginning of a line as an ordered list start, since it's most likely a page number.
Changed macport target to use 'openssl md5' instead of 'md5sum', which isn't found on OSX.
Separated $(web_dest) and website targets. Fixed a bug in index.txt.in.
Fixed bug in LaTeX writer.  When a footnote ends with a Verbatim environment, the close } of the footnote needs to occur on the same line or an error occurs.  Fixed by adding a newline before the close } in every footnote.
Build web index from a template (including version number).
Minor formatting change in README.
Made index.txt in web a template (with @VERSION@).
Minor change in INSTALL instructions.
Updated Makefile for macports instead of macport.
Moved macport -> macports.
Removed macports.
Added macport directory.
Removed macports (renamed as macport).
Modifications in freebsd packaging: + Added freebsd target to Makefile, which creates Makefile from   Makefile.in and creates distinfo. + Removed Makefile and distinfo from the repository.
Added macport target to Makefile; Portfile is now built from a template.
Make Portfile into a template.
Added macports Portfile.
Added note about installation of GMP.framework to Mac OSX package.
Removed incorrect "{}" around style information in HTML tables.  Adjusted test suite accordingly.  Column widths now work properly in HTML.
Bumped version numbers to 0.42 in anticipation of next bugfix release.
Added new rule for enhanced markdown ordered lists: if the list marker is a capital letter followed by a period (including a single-letter capital roman numeral), then it must be followed by at least two spaces. The point of this is to avoid accidentally treating people's initials as list markers: a paragraph may begin:
Use UTF8 conversion on the extra files loaded in Main.hs (header, before, after).  This fixes problems with unicode characters in these files.
Added a needed 'try' to listItem in Markdown reader.
Code cleanup in Markdown reader.
Changes to Markdown reader for better conformity to the Markdown test suite under --strict: + Removed check for a following setext header in endline.   A full test is too inefficient (doubles benchmark time), and   the substitute we had before is not 100% accurate. + Don't use Code elements for autolinks if --strict specified.
If --strict and not --toc, don't include identifiers in headers.
Formatting changes to freebsd Makefile.
+ debian/control: add XS-Vcs-{Svn,Browser} fields + debian/changelog: adjust the author line for the package upload
Changes to freebsd port for 0.41.
Revised website for 0.41.
Bump version to 0.41.
Added signature on changelog.
Modified debian/changelog.
Refactor RST and Markdown readers using parseFromString.
Added a necessary "try" in definition of "para" (HTML reader).
Bug fixes in readers: + LaTeX reader:  skip anything after \end{document} + HTML reader: fixed bug skipping material after </html> -- previously,   stuff at the end was skipped even if no </html> was present, which   meant only part of the file would be parsed and no error issued + HTML reader: added new constant eitherBlockOrInline with elements that   may count either as block-level or inline + Modified isInline and isBlock to take this into account + modified rawHtmlBlock to accept any tag (even an inline tag);   this is innocuous, because rawHtmlBlock is tried only if a regular   inline element can't be parsed.
+ Fixed bug in markdown ordered list parsing.  The problem was   that anyOrderedListStart did not check for a space following the   ordered list marker. So, 'A.B. 2007' would be parsed as a list item,   then fail because of the lack of space after 'A.' (required by   orderedListStart). Resolves Issue #22. + Fixed a similar problem in RST reader. + Added regression test.
Added highlight.css to website.
Fixed block quote output in markdown writer:  previously, block quotes in notes would be indented only in the first line.
Put note in INSTALL about the extra xmlns attribute inserted by later versions of the xhtml library (which causes some tests to fail).  Thanks to Leif LeBaron for pointing this out.
Changed date on README.
Small website tweak:  README.txt, not README-WINDOWS.txt.
Small changes to website.
Simplified Makefile install-all and uninstall-all targets.
Minor tweaks on website (deb description).
Cosmetic changes.
Fixed bug in tarball target in Makefile (should be RELNAME instead of fullname).
Added note that deb will work on Ubuntu to website.
Documented fix for paragraphs starting with (C) in README.
Brought debian/changelog up to date.
LaTeX reader: parse \texttt{} as code, as long as there's nothing fancy inside.
Fixed bug in normalizeSpaces:  Space:Str "":Space should compress to Space.
Allow htmlComments as rawHtmlInline in HTML reader.
Changed (C) to a unicode copyright symbol.
Website improvements.
Updated PROFILING instructions.
Updated debian/changelog.
Major code cleanup in all modules. (Removed unneeded imports, reformatted, etc.)  More major changes are documented below:
Major change in the way ordered lists are handled: + The changes are documented in README, under Lists. + The OrderedList block element now stores information   about list number style, list number delimiter, and   starting number. + The readers parse this information, when possible. + The writers use this information to style ordered   lists. + Test suites have been changed accordingly.
Added parsing for \url to LaTeX reader.
Use \url{} for autolinks in LaTeX writer.
Removed test for examplep in markdown2pdf.
Removed references to examplep package in documentation, and removed suggest of latex-texlive-extras in debian/control, since we're not using examplep.
For website demo, don't use 2-column latex, as the verbatim environments don't wrap.
Brought test suite up to date.
Changes to Markdown reader: + added try to def of indentSpaces + in def of 'reference', check to make sure it's not a note reference   first.
Removed examplep specific stuff in LaTeX reader.
LaTeX writer: + No longer using examplep (too many quirks, too hard to install) + Instead, using deVerb function for environments that don't support   \verb + And fancyvrb for footnotes and verbatim environments in footnotes. + Add fancyvrb to header if Code inline occurs in a footnote.
Removed examplep from LaTeX header.
Use 11pt font by default in ConTeXt header.
Changed [URL] to [url] in description of --asciimathml option.
Cleaned up and fixed autolinks in RST.  All that's needed is a bare email address or URL.  This is now handled with a separate matching clause in the definition of inlineToRST, rather than with conditionals.
Don't put autolinks in typewriter font in ConTeXt, since ConTeXt has its own way of printing links.
Fixed problems with obfuscateLink introduced by last round of changes.  Changed type so that text parameter is String, not HTML, which allows easier testing for autolinks.
Changes in LaTeX reader to accommodate Pandoc's own use of examplep.
Main: Changed putStr to putStrLn -- mainly because MacOS doesn't display the whole output unless there's a line ending.
Man page writer:  modified treatment of autolinks, in accord with recent change from Str to Code.
LaTeX writer:  include fancyvrb and \VerbatimFootnotes line in header only if absolutely needed -- that is, only if there is actually a code block in a footnote.
Makefile:  instead of testing for existence of pandoc symlink in build-exec, use the -f option in ln.
Simplified HTML writer's treatment of autolinks. There are now a few different cases for Link, and less conditional logic needed.
Updated testsuite.native - autolinks should have the URL in Code, not Str.
LaTeX writer tests updated, + for new handling of verbatim environments + for change from textwidth to columnwidth in table output   (so that tables look right in columnar output)
Make URLs and emails in autolinks appear as Code.
Fixed a bug in Docbook writer:  email links with text were being incorrectly treated as autolinks.
Reinstated dependence on fancyvrb.  It is compatible with examplep. fancyvrb is needed for verbatim environments in footnotes.
Changed LaTeX writer to use the examplep package instead of fancyvrb. examplep allows verbatim text in places where fancyvrb does not, e.g. definition list terms, and provides for line-breaking of verbatim text. + examplep code put in LaTeX header instead of being dynamically   included, since it is frequently used, and people may want to   customize the options. + documented dependency on examplep + added texlive-latex-extra as a "Suggested" package in debian/control + use examplep's \Q{} is now used instead of \verb:  note that   \Q requires backslash- escaping symbols in its scope. + modified README so that the verbatim sections will look good at   shorter line lengths.
Use ` as default character for \verb in LaTeX output. If ` is in the content to be escaped, another symbol will be used as before.
Use HTML version of README in OSX installer, instead of plain text or RTF (since RTF tables don't work well in OSX Preview).
Brought changelog up to date.
Include empty \author{} in LaTeX preamble if no author specified; otherwise LaTeX gives an error.
Fixes in LaTeX writer: + put \VerbatimFootnotes right before \title block, to avoid   bad interactions. + added deVerb in description list. + removed \texttt{} from deVerb, because it cannot go in description   lists.
Updated copyright date and debian changelog.
Updated documentation on ASCIIMathML.js.
Changed how ASCIIMathML is handled: + -m|--asciimathml option now takes an *optional* argument,   the URL to an asciiMathML.js script.  This is much better   in situations where multiple files with math must be served,   as the script can be cached. + If the argument is provided, a link is inserted; otherwise,   the whole script is inserted as before. + Nothing is inserted unless there is inline LaTeX.
Modified fancy s5 test in light of asciiMathML changes.
Copyright date change - README.
README: Use definition list for command-line options.
CSS changes in website: better display of definition lists for command-line options.
README: Added missing ~ after '~a\ cat' in subscript example.
Fixed bug in TOC generation in HTML writer (regression, introduced by the revision in the WriterState type).
Website: add feature "Markdown inside HTML blocks."
LaTeX writer: Make sure \VerbatimFootnotes goes after the preamble; otherwise it has bad interaction effects with the other stuff in the header.
Use README instead of README.rtf in Welcome page of Mac OSX package, because the RTF tables don't render right in Mac's preview app.
Modified myheader.tex in website in light of changes in default latex header.
Added quotes around attribute in ASCIIMathML link example (in README).
In HTML reader, filter Nulls in lists of blocks. (These can be caused by raw HTML when the parse-raw option isn't selected.)
Fixed bug in spanStrikeout:  case was not exhaustive.
Updated changelog.
Updated copyright date in debian/copyright.
README:  Removed the statement that the RST reader doesn't parse definition lists. HTML reader:  Added failIfStrict to the definitionList parser, so definition lists will be passed through as raw HTML if --strict specified.
Added support for definition lists to RST reader. Added a relevant test to the test suite.
Added definition list support to HTML reader. Added a test for definition lists to the html-reader test suite.
Added support for definition lists to LaTeX reader.
Renamed parseFromStr -> parseFromString.
Updated RST reader test.
Superscript and Subscript support for RST reader.
Added a "try" to the end parser in enclosed (Text.Pandoc.ParserCombinators). This makes errors in its use less likely. Removed some now-unneeded try's in calling code.
Added subscript and superscript support to LaTeX reader.
Updated PROFILING for new Cabal.
Clarified role of --strict option when input is HTML.
Removed lines from LaTeXHeader that will be supplied dynamically by the LaTeX writer, depending on the document's content.
markdown2pdf:  Print a helpful message if ulem package is not found.
Man writer:  Use ~ and ^ for subscripts and superscripts.
HTML writer:  Use a record for state, instead of a tuple, for easy extensibility.
HTML writer:  include css for .strikethrough only if strikethrough is actually used in the document.
Main: Relabeled asciiMathMLLink -> asciiMathML, asciiMathML -> math.
Updated test suite for writers, adding tests for strikeout, superscript, subscript.
Added ~ to the list of characters the markdown writer should backslash-escape.
LaTeX reader:  Added clauses for tilde and caret. Tilde is \ensuremath{\sim}, and caret is \^{}, not \^ as before.
Cleaned up character escaping in LaTeX writer.
Removed an extra occurance of escapedChar in definition of inline.
Updated latex writer test because of new system for writing the preamble.
Fixed newline issue at end of man page writer test.
Changed /hfil/break to /crlf in ConTeXt writer test suite.
Man writer: + Make sure to include "" if no section is specified   in a man page TH line. + Updated man writer tests.
Changed text to char for one character strings in RST, Man, and Docbook writers.
Markdown writer: Substituted char for text for single characters.
+ Added support for superscript, subscript, and   strikeout to all writers. (Thanks to Bradley Kuhn   for the patches for strikeout, here slightly modified.) + Refactored character escaping using the new functions   escapeStringUsing and backslashEscapes. + Added state to LaTeX writer, which now keeps track of what   packages need to be included in the preamble, based on the   content of the document. (Thus, e.g., ulem is only required   if you use strikeout.)
Added support for strikeout (\sout) to latex reader.  (Thanks to Bradley Sif for the patch.)
Added support for Strikeout, Superscript, and Subscript to HTML reader.  Thanks to Bradley Sif for the patch for Strikeout (Issue #18).
+ Added support for Strikeout, Superscript, and   Subscript in markdown reader. + Also replaced constants like emphStart with literals.
+ Added Strikeout support to Markdown writer.
Moved failIfStrict from Markdown reader to Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Documented fact that --strict option has a role even when input format is not markdown (in README).
Changes to functions for character escaping: + Removed escapeCharAsString + Added escapeStringUsing + Changed backslashEscape to backslashEscapes, which   now returns an association list of escapes to be   passed to escapeStringUsing
Changed man page markdown sources to use new system for specifying title, section, and header information.
Use capital letters for title in sample man page title block.
Changed system for indicating man page title, section, header and footer.  Documented in README.
Updated website feature descriptions.
README changes: + Documented superscript, subscript, and strikeout syntax + Modified description of LaTeX packages needed for markdown2pdf
Added Strikeout, Superscript, and Subscript to refsMatch function in Pandoc.Shared.
Added Strikeout, Superscript, and Subscript as Inline elements (Pandoc.Definition).
Small modification in formatting of web demos.
Refactored character escaping in Text.Pandoc.Writers.Markdown using escapeCharAsString.
Added escapeCharAsString to Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Updated INSTALL instructions with some extra clarifications and links.
Changed destination in changelog to 'unstable', because lintian complains about 'UNRELEASED'.
Backup 'var' before making deb and restore after. Reason: In because in the process of making the debian package, 'var' gets overwritten with the local debian build directory as DESTDIR. This will break future 'make uninstall's, which will try to delete files from there instead of /usr/local (or wherever).
Brought debian/changelog up to date.
markdown2pdf.in:  Test for --table-of-contents as well as --toc.
Simplified inlinesInBalanced, using lookAhead.
Revised package synopsis in pandoc.cabal.
Modified the test of a link containing an underscore in both the label and the URL.  The underscore must be backslash-escaped.
Markdown reader:  Added inlinesInBalanced parser combinator to unify treatment of embedded brackets in links and inline footnotes. Note that the solution adopted here causes one of John Gruber's markdown tests to fail:   [with_underscore](/url/with_underscore) Here the whole phrase "underscore](/url/with" is treated as emphasized. The previous version of the markdown reader handled this the way Gruber's script handles it, but it ran into trouble on the following:   [link with verbatim `]`](/url) where the inner ] was treated as the end of the reference link label. I don't see any good way to handle both cases in the framework of pandoc, so I choose to require an escape in the first example:   [with\_underscore](/url/with_underscore)
Added charsInBalanced parser combinator to Text.Pandoc.ParserCombinators. This is not currently used, but should be useful in parsing strings containing balanced pairs of brackets or parentheses.
debian/control: For pandoc package, suggest 'texlive-latex-recommended | tetex-extra' instead of 'texlive-latex-base | tetex-bin'.  This brings in fancyvrb, which is used in the default LaTeX header, and (at least in texlive) unicode support.
Changes to ConTeXt test suite.
ConTeXt writer changes: + Use defined blockquote environment for block quotes (smaller   font, no indent, narrower text) + Changed default font to 12pt + Changed default page layout
Documented ConTeXt writer in README.  Removed statement that table output is limited to HTML and LaTeX writers, since it is now supported in all writers.
Main.hs:  If writer is "context", automatically select smart quotes option. web/demos:  Removed redundant -S in context writer demo.
Documented ConTeXt writer in pandoc man page.
Changes to the website: + Mentioned ConTeXt writer in general description. + Added two demos involving the ConTeXt writer.
If output file has .ctx or .context extension, assume it is ConTeXt format unless otherwise specified.
Updated FreeBSD pkg-descr to mention groff man and ConTeXt output formats.
Updated package descriptions in debian/control to mention ConTeXt writer.
Updated package description in pandoc.cabal to include ConTeXt output format.
Merged branches/context:  addition of a ConTeXt writer <http://www.pragma-ade.nl/>. + Text.Pandoc.Writers.ConTeXt added. + Text.Pandoc modified to export the basic ConTeXt writer. + Main.hs modified to recognize 'context' as a writer. + ConTeXtHeader added to headers + DefaultHeaders.hs template modified to include ConTeXt header + Tests added (writer.context, tables.context), and runtests.pl   modified to run them + pandoc.cabal updated to include Text.Pandoc.Writers.ConTeXt.
Removed an unused function in LaTeX writer.
Simplified special character escaping code in LaTeX writer.
Small comment fix in LaTeX writer.
Removed some unnecessary files from web directory.
Revamped website.
Changed title in README to "Pandoc User's Guide."
Change to footnotes in HTML writer:  Instead of putting the footnote backlink on a line by itself, after the content of the note, we now put it at the end of the last paragraph of the footnote. This saves space and looks better.  More specifically: + If the last block of the note is a Para or Plain block, the   backlink is put at the end of that block's contents. + Otherwise, the backlink is put in a separate Plain block by   itself, after the footnote's contents.
Minor modification in debian/control: + Suggest 'texlive-latex-base | tetex-bin' as per the suggestion of Debian   TeX Task force: 	http://pkg-tetex.alioth.debian.org/mapping-texlive.html#general + As for the 'latex-ucs', it dates from those days of teTeX which didn't   support UTF-8 and it will probably become obsolete some day.  Hence, we   shouldn't rely on it.
Added note in README about how you might want to link to an external ASCIIMathML.js script instead of including it in the generated HTML file using -m.
Changes to debian/control: + Description updated with new features. + Suggest latex-ucs instead of tetex-bin.  latex-ucs will bring in   either tetex-bin or texlive-latex-base, and will ensure that the   package required to use UTF-8 is present.  Note: texlive   is now the preferred debian LaTeX package.
Changed encodeUTF8 to toUTF8, decodeUTF8 to fromUTF8, for clarity.
Cleaned up Text.Pandoc.  Added lots of documentation, including an example program.
HTML reader: haddock comment fix.
Main: use Text.Pandoc to simplify list of imported modules.
Export NoteTable in Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Fuller package description in pandoc.cabal.
Pandoc.hs: + added haddock documentation + added export of prettyPandoc and writeMan
Change to defaultWriterOptions:  standalone is False by default.
Minor formatting tweaks for pandoc website.
Make sure custom header includes things needed for tables! Also, remove paragraph spacing commands, so it looks more different from the default.
Removed odf demo from website Examples page.  (docbook2odf is buggy on code blocks, and anyway we're demonstrating pandoc here, not docbook2odf.)
Slightly larger table of header identifiers, so stuff doesn't wrap on LaTeX output.
README: Documented scheme for header identifiers in HTML.
Documented --toc/--table-of-contents option in pandoc man page and README.
If writer == "s5", don't set table of contents option. (The TOC would have to be put on a slide, but in most cases it won't fit anyway.)
Changed order of options, for aesthetic reasons.
Further tweaks to website css.
Small css tweaks for website. (Smaller sans-serif font, larger monospace for balance.)
Changes to website: + Makefile: rebuild examples if 'demos' changes + New syntax for docbook2odf example + New --toc examples for HTML and RST
Use smartquotes and table of contents in generating README.html.
Small changes to website.
Updated features.txt in website.
README: Documented man page writer, special title-line conventions for man pages.
Use "Pandoc User Manuals" as bottom-left footer in man pages.
Recognize output filenames with any single-digit extension as man format.
Added a test case with an inline link containing bracketed text.
Minor cosmetic changes to runtests.pl ("passed" in lowercase, to distinguish more clearly from "FAILED").
Markdown reader: Parse bracketed text in inline footnotes. Previously, "test^[my [note] contains brackets]" would yield a note with contents "my [note". Now it yields a note with contents "my [note] contains brackets".  New function: inlinesInBrackets.
RST reader:  Allow hyperlink target URIs to be split over multiple lines, and to start on the line after the reference. Resolves Issue 7.
Moved Text.ParserCombinators.Pandoc -> Text.Pandoc.ParserCombinators.  This way, all the Pandoc modules are in one place.
Added type declaration for hsepBlocks in Text.Pandoc.Blocks.
+ Cleaned up runtests.pl.  Incorporated table tests in loop with   main writer tests. + Renamed tables.tex to tables.latex, tables.db to tables.docbook,   for consistency with the writer tests.
Text.Pandoc.Blocks: + Fixed a bug in hPad, which previously padded the rightmost   cell.  This is fixed by introducing a case for a singleton   list. + Fixed Markdown writer so that the space after a table is not   nested two spaces. + Adjusted Markdown table tests accordingly.
Markdown writer: Fixed a small problem with lengths of dashed lines in tables.
Added --toc support to Markdown writer.
Added support for --toc to RTF writer.
Moved isHeaderBlock from Text.Pandoc.Writers.HTML to Text.Pandoc.Shared.
Regularized the scheme for unique header identifiers in HTML writer:  - punctuation is now all removed (except -)  - spaces are turned into -  - all lowercase This scheme should be fairly predictable. Updated tests accordingly.
Changes to tests to accommodate r653.
HTML writer changes: + change in scheme for construction of unique identifiers for headers:   - all lowercase   - spaces turn into -, not _ + TOC items now have their own identifiers, starting with TOC- + when there is a TOC, headers link back to the corresponding TOC items,   rather than the top of the TOC.
Added --toc support to RST writer.
Modified markdown2pdf to run pdflatex a second time if --toc was specified; otherwise the table of contents won't appear.
Man writer:  Don't print .\" t at beginning unless we're in --standalone mode.
LaTeX writer: + Leave extra blank line after \maketitle + Insert \tableofcontents if --toc option was selected
HTML writer: Slight change in code for generating unique identifiers.  The numbers used after duplicate identifiers are now separated from them by a hyphen:  Duplicate-1 rather than Duplicate1.
Added tests for man writer to runtests.pl.
Fixed bug in Notes ($$ instead of <>), which caused note blocks to be indented.
Added version of test suite for man page.
Man page templates: Escaped --'s in option list headers, so they won't be parsed as Em dashes when -S mode is used.
Use -S option in building man pages.
Added test suites for RST, markdown, and man tables.
Updated tests to account for changes in HTML writer (identifiers).
Adjusted copyright notices to 2006-7; use real email address instead of lamely attempting to obfuscate.
Added table tests for all writers.
Haddock documentation for Text.Pandoc.Blocks.
Man writer:  Use integral n measures instead of fractional i measures.  Calculate on basis of a 70 character line, since the default is 78 but the table will appear indented 8 spaces in standard man output.
Added Maintainer and Copyright fields to pandoc.cabal.
Put table of contents in its own div (id="toc").
HTML writer modifications: + Added code to HTML Writer to generate a table of contents if the   writerTableOfContents option is specified.  This is an unordered list   with links to the headers.  It is constructed hierarchically, based on   the order of the headers and their levels. + If a TOC is used, the headers become links back to the TOC. + Removed Toc from WriterState; instead, the TOC is generated at the top   level, by the function tableOfContents. + Fixed a bug in uniqueIdentifiers which prevented it from handling more than   one duplicate.
+ Introduced writerIgnoreNotes option in WriterOptions.  This is needed   for processing header blocks for a table of contents, since notes on   headers should not appear in the TOC.  Set default in Main.hs. + Moved Element, headerAtLeast, and hierarchicalize from Docbook writer   to Text.Pandoc.Shared.  This is because HTML writer now uses these in   constructing a table of contents.
Added writerTableOfContents to WriterOptions, and added a --table-of-contents/--toc command-line option to Main.hs.
Renamed Pandoc.cabal -> pandoc.cabal, for better compatibility with HackageDB, which likes the cabal file to have the same name as the tarball.  Modified references to Pandoc.cabal in INSTALL and Makefile.
Changes to HTML writer to incorporate automatic identifiers for headers and table of contents: + WriterState now includes a list of header identifiers and a table   of contents in addition to notes. + The function uniqueIdentifiers creates a list of unique identifiers   from a list of inline lists (e.g. headers). + This list is part of WriterState and gets consumed by blockToHtml   each time a header is encountered. + Headers are now printed with unique identifiers based on their names,   e.g. Shell_scripts for "# Shell scripts".  Fancy stuff like links,   italics, etc. gets ignored.  A numerical index is added to the end if   there is already an identifier by the same name, e.g. "Shell_scripts1". + Provision has been made for a table-of-contents block element, but this   has not yet been added.
Minor comment change.
Pandoc.hs: Export all definitions in Text.Pandoc.Definition, rather than exporting the module.
README: Documented the fact that if pandoc is called as 'hsmarkdown', it runs in strict markdown compatibility mode.  This can be achieved using a symbolic link.
Minor wording changes in README.
Fixed bug in Markdown reader:  links in footnotes were not being processed.  Solution:  three-stage parse.  First, get all the reference keys and add information to state.  Next, get all the notes and add information to state.  (Reference keys may be needed at this stage.)  Finally, parse everything else.
Added table support to RST writer.
Added table support to markdown writer.
Improvements/bug fixes to Text.Pandoc.Blocks library.
Include Text.Pandoc.Blocks in Pandoc.cabal's file list.
Added Text.Pandoc.Blocks module for prettyprinting of text tables.
Man writer: - Added scheme for specifying manual section and additional   headers:   % PROGNAM | 1 | User Manual | Version 4.0 - Modified man page sources to include section 1
Added table support to man writer (using the tbl preprocessor). The writer state now includes a list of "preprocessor" codes. If the document contains a table, "t" (for "tbl") is added to the list. If this list is nonempty, the man page starts with .\" <list> which instructs man to run the file through the appropriate preprocessor before processing with groff.
Changes to website: - Added groff man to list of output formats in index.txt - Added a demo of man page creation to demos page
FreeBSD Makefile - bump version to 0.4, and require GHC 6.6 or higher.
Documented man output in pandoc.1.md man page.
Man writer:  don't change - to \- (minus sign). Leave them as hyphens.
Man writer:  better output for line break: .PD 0     # set interparagraph space to 0 .P        # new paragraph .PD       # reset interparagraph space to default.
Minor changes in Man writer: - escape ' as \[aq], because ' can trigger groff commands. - remove unneeded line breaks. - use CR font in code blocks. - use .P 0 for line breaks.
Don't use -S option in processing man pages, since the '--' in options will be read as an En-dash.
Minor changes in man page sources.
Man pages are now generated from markdown templates, using pandoc's man page writer.  Removed man pages from repository, added (.md) templates.  Modified Makefile to generate man pages as part of the build process.
Modified escaping in Man writer.  Also changed format of footnote references and authors list.
Modified Main.hs and Pandoc.cabal to add man page writer.
Added groff man writer.
Makefile changes: + Include files built from templates in the distribution tarball,   so it can be built using Cabal and included in Hackage. + Remove unnecessary 'cabalize' step.  We no longer build   Pandoc.cabal from a template.
Include Pandoc.cabal in repository; do not generate it from Pandoc.cabal.in using cabalize.  Removed cabalize and Pandoc.cabal.in, which are no longer needed. Reason:  We want Pandoc to be buildable using Cabal without preprocessing, so it can go into the Hackage repository of Haskell libraries.
Changed documentation to indicate that GHC 6.6 is required. We will no longer support GHC 6.4.
Minor documentation changes to ASCIIMathML.hs template.
Adjust Debian package dependencies: + add libghc6-mtl-dev + remove version condition from libghc6-xhtml-dev
Added RTF table writer tests.
Require blankspace (but not multiple lines) between URL and title in links and reference keys.  (Markdown reader.)
Fixed bug with indented blocks occurring in definition lists.
Updated test suite with new tests for definition lists.
Improved prettyprinting of definition lists.
Added support for definition lists in Docbook writer.
+ Use new alignment parameter in title/author/date,   instead of hardcoded \qc. + Adjusted test suite to account for changes in RTF writer.
Changes to RTF writer: + Added support for definition lists. + Removed extra '\cell' in table output, which caused   a blank column to the left. + Added support for captions in tables. + Added an 'alignment' parameter to RTF block writers. + Added support for column alignments in tables.
Added support for definition lists to RST writer.
Added support for definition lists to markdown writer.
Add -asxhtml flag to tidy in html2markdown.  This will perhaps help the parser.
Changed definition list syntax in markdown reader and simplified the parsing code. A colon is now required before every block in a definition. This fixes a problem with the old syntax, in which the last block in the following was ambiguous between a regular paragraph in the definition and a code block following the definition list:
Resolved issue #10:  instead of adding "\n\n" to the end of strings in Main, do it in readMarkdown and readRST. (Note: the point of this is to ensure that a block at the end of the file gets treated as if it has blank space after it, which is generally what is wanted.)
Fixed bug in anyLine parser.  Previously anyLine would parse an empty string "".  But it should fail on an empty string, or we get an error from its use inside "many" combinators.
Support for definition lists in LaTeX writer.
Fixed export declarations; removed unneeded import of Pandoc.Shared.
Moved escape and nullBlock parsers from ParserCombinators/Pandoc to Pandoc/Shared.  Reason:  ParserCombinators/Pandoc is for general-purpose parsers that don't require Pandoc.Definition. Also removed some unnecessary imports from Pandoc/Shared.
Updated test suite to reflect new prettyprinted native Table format.
Added Table to prettyBlock in Shared.hs.
Added Text.Pandoc module that exports basic readers, writers, definitions, and utility functions.
Extensive changes stemming from a rethinking of the Pandoc data structure. Key and Note blocks have been removed. Link and image URLs are now stored directly in Link and Image inlines, and note blocks are stored in Note inlines. This requires changes in both parsers and writers. Markdown and RST parsers need to extract data from key and note blocks and insert them into the relevant inline elements. Other parsers can be simplified, since there is no longer any need to construct separate key and note blocks. Markdown, RST, and HTML writers need to construct lists of notes; Markdown and RST writers need to construct lists of link references (when the --reference-links option is specified); and the RST writer needs to construct a list of image substitution references. All writers have been rewritten to use the State monad when state is required.  This rewrite yields a small speed boost and considerably cleaner code.
Fixed bug in email obfuscation (issue #15). If the text to be obfuscated contains an entity, this needs to be decoded before obfuscation. Thanks to thsutton for the patch.
Removed Blank block element as unnecessary.
Consolidated 'text', 'special', and 'inline' into 'inline'.
Added trys to two list start routines.  Reason: <|> only parses second parser when first hasn't consumed input.
Added clauses for DefinitionList and Table to replaceReferenceLinks in Text/Pandoc/Shared.hs. This ensures that reference-style links inside tables and definition lists will be handled properly.
Simplified keyTable, using assumption that key blocks are not inside other block elements (an assumption that the Markdown reader uses in making its initial pass anyway).
Changes to Markdown reader relating to definition lists: + fixed bug in indentSpaces (which didn't properly handle   cases with mixed spaces and tabs) + rewrote definition list code to conform to new syntax + include definition lists in list block + failIfStrict on definition lists
Added support for DefinitionList blocks to HTML writer. Cleaned up bullet and ordered list code by using ordList and unordList instead of raw olist and ulist.
New syntax documentation for definition lists.  Now we require a ':' at the beginning of the definition; otherwise, too many false positives for definition lists.
Fixed bug in HTML email obfuscation using --strict mode. The problem is that the "href" function escapes &, so (href "&#108;") is 'href="&amp;#108;"'.  Fixed by using primHtml for the whole link.  Resolves issue 9.
Changed syntax of definition lists in Markdown parser:   + definition blocks must be indented throughout (not     just in first line)   + compact lists can be formed by leaving no blank line     between a definition and the next term
Added documentation for definition lists.
Added parser for definition lists, derived from reStructuredText syntax:
Modified prettyPandoc to handle DefinitionList elements.
Added definition for DefinitionList block element.
Change in ordered lists in Markdown reader:   + Lists may begin with lowercase letters only, and only 'a' through     'n'. Otherwise first initials and page references (e.g., p. 400)     are too easily parsed as lists.   + Numbers beginning list items must end with '.' (not ')', which is     now allowed only after letters). NOTE:  This change may cause documents to be parsed differently. Users should take care in upgrading.
More smart quote adjustments: + remove support for all-caps contractions (too   much potential for conflict with things like   'M. Mitterand') + add support for 'm as a contraction
Smart quote parsing in Markdown reader: treat ' followed by ll, re, ve, then a non-letter, as a contraction.  (e.g. I've, you're, he'll)
Fixed bug in noscript part of email obfuscation: & instead of &amp;
Made image parsing in HTML reader sensitive to the --inline-links option.
Added --inline-links option to force links in HTML to be parsed as inline links, rather than reference links.  (Addresses Issue #4.)
Strip executable binaries before installing.
Changes to test suite for new XHTML output.
Modified HTML writer to use the Text.XHtml library.  This results in cleaner, faster code, and it makes it easier to use Pandoc in other projects, like wikis, that use Text.XHtml.  Two functions are now provided, writeHtml and writeHtmlString:  the former outputs an Html structure, the latter a rendered string.  The S5 writer is also changed, in parallel ways (writeS5, writeS5String).  The Html header is now written programmatically, so it has been removed from the 'headers' directory.  The S5 header is still needed, but the doctype and some of the meta declarations have been removed, since they are written programatically.  The INSTALL file and cabalize have been updated to reflect the new dependency on the xhtml package.
'cp -a' does not work in BSD.  Replace with 'cp -R'. Note that we don't want user and group to be preserved, anyway.
Modified changelog: note on defaultWriterOptions.
Added defaultWriterOptions to Shared.hs.
Modified changelog to incorporate changes since the 0.3 release.
Use 'highlight' to produce syntax-highlighted versions of xml, html, and tex demo pages (in website /examples/). Add links so that html files can be viewed as web pages (without syntax highlighting).
Change extensions of example text files in website demo to '.text' -- the only reason for this is that I use '.txt' for page source files, and generally exclude them from being uploaded to the website.
In writing Markdown, print unicode nonbreaking space (160) as "&nbsp;", since otherwise it is hard to distinguish from a regular space.  (Addresses Issue #3.)
Escape non-breaking space in SGML as '&nbsp;' instead of printing a unicode non-breaking space, which is hard to distinguish visually from a regular space. (Resolves issue #3.)
Refactored str and strong in Markdown reader, for clarity.
Got rid of two unneeded 'getState's.  Note that lookAhead automatically saves and restores the state.
Use lookAhead instead of getInput/setInput in RST reader.
Use lookAhead parser for the "first pass" looking for reference keys in Markdown parser, instead of parsing normally, then using setInput to reset input.  Slight performance improvement.
Removed followedBy' parser from Text/ParserCombinators/Pandoc, replacing it with the 'lookAhead' parser from Text/ParserCombinators/Parsec.
Introduced a new map, reverseEntityTable, for lookups of entity by character, in Entities.hs. This yields a small performance improvement.
Changed Entities.hs to use Data.Map rather than an association list, for a slight performance boost.
Added freebsd directory, with freebsd port, to repository.
Fixed issue #8:  slow performance in parsing inline literals in RST reader.  The problem was that ``#`` was seen by 'inline' as a potential link or image.  Fix:  insert 'notFollowedBy (char '`')' in link parsers.
Replaced "choice [(try (string ...), ...]" idiom with "oneOfStrings" in LaTeX reader.
+ Added some needed "try"s before multicharacter parsers,   especially in "option" contexts. + Removed the "try" from the "end" parser in "enclosed"   (Text.Pandoc.Shared).  Now "enclosed" behaves like   "option", "manyTill", etc.
Added 'try' in front of 'string', where needed, or used a different parser, in RST reader. This fixes a bug where ````` would not be correctly parsed as a verbatim `.
Allow the URI in a RST hyperlink target to start on the line after the reference key.
Added link to FreeBSD port in website.
Use "gaps" in copyrightMessage string for cleaner code formatting.
Changed 'encodeEntities' to 'escapeSGMLString'.
+ Simplified entity handling by removing stringToSGML from Entities.hs.   It is no longer needed now that all entities are processed in the markdown   and HTML readers.  All calls to stringToSGML have been replaced by calls   to encodeEntities. + Since inTag's attribute handling already encodes entities,   calls to encodeEntities are no longer needed for attribute values, so   they've been removed. + The HTML and Markdown readers now call decodeEntities on all raw   strings (e.g. authors, dates, link titles), to ensure that no unprocessed   entities are included in the native representation of the document.   (In the HTML reader, most of this work is done by a change in   extractAttributeName.) + The result is a small speed improvement (around 5% on my benchmark)   and cleaner code.
Use encodeEntities rather than stringToSGML for contents of Str inline in Docbook and HTML writers, since now these strings should not contain literal entity references.
Cleaned up handling of embedded quotes in link titles. Now these are stored as a '"' character, not as '&quot;'. The function escapeLinkTitle in the Markdown writer is unnecessary and was removed.  Tests modified accordingly.
More changes in entity handling:  Instead of using entities for characters above 128 in HTML and Docbook output, we now just use unicode.  After all, we're declaring UTF-8 content in the header.  This makes the HTML and docbook files produced by pandoc much more readable and editable.
Changes in entity handling: + Entities are parsed (and unicode characters returned) in both   Markdown and HTML readers. + Parsers characterEntity, namedEntity, decimalEntity, hexEntity added   to Entities.hs; these parse a string and return a unicode character. + Changed 'entity' parser in HTML reader to use the 'characterEntity'   parser from Entities.hs. + Added new 'entity' parser to Markdown reader, and added '&' as a   special character.  Adjusted test suite accordingly since now we   get 'Str "AT",Str "&",Str "T"' instead of 'Str "AT&T".. + stringToSGML moved to Entities.hs.  escapeSGML removed as redundant,   given encodeEntities. + stringToSGML, encodeEntities, and specialCharToEntity are given a   boolean parameter that causes only numerical entities to be used.   This is used in the docbook writer.  The HTML writer uses named   entities where possible, but not all docbook-consumers know about   the named entities without special instructions, so it seems safer   to use numerical entities there. + decodeEntities is rewritten in a way that avoids Text.Regex, using   the new parsers. + charToEntity and charToNumericalEntity added to Entities.hs. + Moved specialCharToEntity from Shared.hs to Entities.hs. + Removed unneeded 'decodeEntities' from 'str' parser in HTML and   Markdown readers. + Removed sgmlHexEntity, sgmlDecimalEntity, sgmlNamedEntity, and   sgmlCharacterEntity from Shared.hs. + Modified Docbook writer so that it doesn't rely on Text.Regex for   detecting "mailto" links.
Rewrote functions in Text/Pandoc/Shared so as not to use Text.Regex, which does not support unicode:   - escapePreservingRegex removed   - stringToSGML rewritten using Parsec parser   - new parsers for SGML character entities   - escapeSGML rewritten using specialCharToEntity   - new function specialCharToEntity
Changed Markdown autoLink parsing to conform better to Markdown.pl's behavior.  <google.com> is not treated as a link, but <http://google.com>, <ftp://google.com>, and <mailto:google@google.com> are.
Fixed bug in 'extractTagType' in HTML reader:  previous version was not skipping / in close tags.
Refactored markdown reader so that Text.Regex is not used. Replaced email regex test with a custom email autolink parser (autoLinkEmail).  Also replaced 'selfClosingTag' with a custom function 'isSelfClosingTag'.
Fixed a bug in extractTagType in HTML Reader:  the previous version extracted the attributes, too, which is not wanted.
Fixed bug in HTML attribute parser:  now a space is required before an attribute.  Previously, <a.b> would be parsed as an HTML tag with an attribute!
Modified Markdown writer to use autolinks when possible. So, instead of [site.com](site.com) we get <site.com>. Changed test suite accordingly.
Rewrote 'extractTagType' in HTML reader so that it doesn't use regexs.
More smart quote bug fixes: + LaTeX writer now handles consecutive quotes properly:   for example, ``\,`hello'\,'' + LaTeX reader now parses '\,' as empty Str + normalizeSpaces function in Shared now removes empty Str elements + Modified tests accordingly
Fixed bug in smart quoting:  recognize ' in contractions like "don't" as not beginning single quoted contexts.
Removed 'gsub' entirely and replaced its uses with 'substitute'.
+ Added a 'substitute' function to Shared.hs.  This is a generic   list function that can be used to substitute one substring   for another in a string, like 'gsub' except without regular   expressions. + Use 'substitute' instead of 'gsub' in the LaTeX writer.  This   avoids what appears to be a bug in Text.Regex, whereby "\\^"   matches "\350".  There seems to be a slight speed improvement   as well.  (Note:  If this works, it would be good to replace   other uses of gsub that don't employ regexs with 'substitute'.)
Small bug fix to last change, and count "'S" as well as "'s" as possessive when followed by non-alphanumeric.
More tweaks to smart quote parsing:  a ' is not a single quote start if followed by 's' and then a non-alphanumeric.  (Yes, this is English-centric, I'm afraid.  But it does help, and I can't think of a language in which 's' by itself is a word.)
Minor tweaks to smart quoting code.
Fixed bug in smart quote recognition:  ' before ) or certain other punctuation must not be an open quote.
Fixed haddock documentation errors.
Fix debian/changelog.
Added support for tables in markdown reader and in LaTeX, DocBook, and HTML writers.  The syntax is documented in README.  Tests have been added to the test suite.
Changed website to link to Google's download details page (with SHA1 checksum) rather than directly to the files.
More website tweaks.  Added demo of extra xsl configuration and CSS in chunked xhtml produced from docbook.
Minor changes to Makefile required by changes to website build system.
More Changes to website target.  Moved to a templating system for the examples page.
More website changes.  Include demo of docbook postprocessed by xmlto.
Reorganized Makefile target - now uses a subsidiary Makefile that can be run from the website directory for small changes.
Need to export TMPDIR in tempdir.sh.
On Cygwin, set TMPDIR to . before using mktemp.  Otherwise one gets an error creating the output file in the /tmp directory. I haven't tracked this one down, but this should serve as a workaround.
Reverted r471.  My alternative to --strip-trailing-cr didn't work.  This only affects the test target on systems without GNU diff (rare), so I'm not too worried about it.
Small tweak on last demo in website.
Added DocBook to description of package in Pandoc.cabal.in.
Small change in web page for "Pandoc features."
Cleaned up markdown2pdf.in.  Note that bibtex does not return an error condition when it gives warnings, so instead we grep for warnings or error messages to see if we need to print the log.
Minor changes to markdown2pdf:  removed an unnecessary '|| exit $?', and made sure error output goes to stderr.
Fixed docbook writer test -- removed named entities.
Don't use named entities in docbook writer.  Instead, use numerical entities, for portability across stylesheets.
Added comment relevant to last revision.
Replaced diff --strip-trailing-cr with something more portable in runtests.pl.  (This is a GNU option.)
Removed "Extra-source-files" from Pandoc.cabal.in, since it seems to cause problems on GHC 6.4.1!
Changes to markdown2pdf.in: + Exit if pandoc fails (second time through) -- no need to store the log for this. + Run pdflatex up to three times, if needed to resolve references.  Also   run bibtex as needed. + Minor reformatting.
Minor cleanups in markdown2pdf.in.
Change to Makefile to add features page to website.
Improvements in website: + Descriptions on examples. + New "features" page highlighting Pandoc's features. + Small other improvements.
Moved up processing of --dump-args so that output file won't be created first!
Added notice about pandoc-announce list to web page.
Small css change on website.
Formatting changes in debian/changelog, and added note about backslash escaping changes.
+ Changed 'escapedChar' in Markdown reader so that only the   characters Markdown escapes are escaped in strict mode.   When not in strict mode, Pandoc allows all non-alphanumeric   characters to be escaped. + Added documentation of backslash escapes to README.
+ Export TEXINPUTS variable.
Various fixes in markdown2pdf.
Removed unneeded "export" statements.
Documentation changes corresponding to r456.
Modified shell scripts to use new Pandoc --dump-args and --ignore-args features.  This allows a simpler, cleaner design.
Have pandoc return exit code 2 whenever a usage message is produced, even if it's because a bad option was specified.
Changes to Pandoc's options to facilitate wrapper scripts: + removed -d/--debug option + added --dump-args option, which prints the name of the output file   (or '-' for STDOUT) and all the command-line arguments (excluding   Pandoc options and their arguments), one per line, then exits.  Note   that special wrapper options will be treated as arguments if they   follow '--' at the end of the command line.  Thus,      pandoc --dump-args -o foo.html foo.txt -- -e latin1   will print the following to STDOUT:      foo.html      foo.txt      -e      latin1 + added --ignore-args option, which causes Pandoc to ignore all   (non-option) arguments, including any special options that occur   after '--' at the end of the command line. + '-' now means STDIN as the name of an input file, STDOUT as the   name of an output file.  So,      pandoc -o - -   will take input from STDIN and print output to STDOUT.  Note that   if multiple '-o' options are specified on the same line, the last   one takes precedence.  So, in a script,      pandoc "$@" -o -   will guarantee output to STDOUT, even if the '-o' option was used. + documented these changes in man pages, README, and changelog.
Added [breaklinks=true] to latex writer test case.
Simplify regex.
+ Revert previous commit which is wrong and insufficient on some parts. + Improve sed filter to extract the following error contexts:   1. From a line starting with ! to the next blank line.   2. From a line beginning "LaTeX Warning:" to the next blank line.   3. From a line beginning "Error:" to the next blank line, or EOF. + Improve the error message headers (perhaps needs a proof reading).   Prepend the wrapper name to the error headers for easy spotting.
+ Fix a nasty bug in markdown2pdf.  It used to send the log file to   /dev/null!
Added [breaklinks=true] to hyperref package in LaTeX header. This produces nicer-looking output by default.
Small improvements to indentSpaces.  (Allow combinations of spaces and tabs.)
Modified HTML output for Image elements, to conform to Markdown.pl: + title attribute comes after alt attribute + title is included even if null
Fixed performance problems with '--strict' option: + Replaced skipEndline with "option ' ' newline" where possible. + Replaced "notFollowedBy' header" in definition of endline with   a faster but equally accurate test for a folliwng header. + Removed check at the beginning of 'reference' for   a noteStart: This is not needed, because note comes before   referenceKey in the definition of block. + Replaced check for a following anyHtmlBlockTag in autoLink   with a check for anyHtmlTag or anyHtmlEndTag. + Other small code cleanups.
Fixed bug in Markdown reader's handling of underscores and other inline formatting markers inside reference labels:  for example, in '[A_B]: /url/a_b', the material between underscores was being parsed as emphasized inlines.
Added support for hexadecimal entities:  e.g. &#xA0AB;
Fixed formatting in pandoc man page.
Allow '-S' option to be specified together with '--strict', if desired. Thus 'pandoc -S --strict -r markdown -w html' can replace the Markdown.pl/Smartypants combination.
Fixed serious performance problems with new Markdown reader: Instead of using lookahead to determine whether a single quote is an apostrophe, we now use state.  Inside single quotes, a ' character won't be recognized as the beginning of a single quote.  'stateQuoteContext' has been added to keep track of this.
Merged changes from 'quotes' branch since r431.  Smart typography is now handled in the Markdown and LaTeX readers, rather than in the writers.  The HTML writer has been rewritten to use the prettyprinting library.
Fix the bug in 'install-all' target which does not install the wrappers. (This target is somewhat special as it should handle installing and _registering_ the library in generic installations.)  We can't rely on 'install-exec' to fix this bug (but we should depend on 'build-exec' nevertheless), since the 'install-all' target already installs pandoc along with the library files.  Therefore we should install wrappers separately by using a helper function which was specifically created to avoid code duplication ('install-exec' target was also updated so as to use this function).
Change the author order in debian/changelog to reflect the order of importance.  Changes in pandoc itself are more important than those in the build system.
Update signature in debian/changelog.
Setup executable permissions on some files.
Remove executable permission of hsmarkdown.in.
Fix the wrapper usage instruction in INSTALL.
Nicer informational message in test-markdown target.
Changed Markdown writer so that it does not use the single-bracket style of implicit reference link.  It now uses [this style][], not [this style].  Reason:  only newer, beta versions of Markdown allow the single-bracket style.
Fixed small bug in consolidateList:  added case for (Str a):Space:Space:rest.
Refactored SGML escaping functions and "in tag" functions to Text/Shared/Pandoc.  (escapeSGML, stringToSGML, inTag, inTagSimple, inTagIndented, selfClosingTag)  These can be used by both the HTML and Docbook writers.
Fixed bug in encodeEntities (characters less than 128, not 127, should be encoded).
Small README changes documenting differences from standard markdown.
Changed test-markdown target in Makefile:  Now it will find any markdown test suites in the 'test' directory (subdirectories beginning with 'MarkdownTest_') and run them all.  This allows us to have multiple test suites, e.g. for 1.0 and for a beta version.
Removed unneeded 'options' parameter from 'indentedInTags' function in Docbook writer.
Added some instructions to INSTALL about setting the PATH for trying out pandoc and the shell scripts from the build directory.
+ Improved text wrapping algorithm in markdown, docbook, and RST writers.   LineBreaks no longer cause ugly wrapping in Markdown output. + Replaced splitBySpace with the more general, polymorphic function   splitBy (in Text/Pandoc/Shared).
Modified HTML reader to skip a newline following a <br> tag. Otherwise the newline will be treated as a space at the beginning of the next line.
Removed unneeded WRAPPER_ARGS and WRAPPEE_ARGS variables from src/wrappers/common.sh.
Cleaned up and improved Makefile target for wrappers.
Improved Makefile 'wrappers' target.  (Previously, it would build all wrappers corresponding to src/wrappers/*.in.  Now, it will only build wrappers in WRAPPERS.  This might be useful if we decide to have 'hsmarkdown' be a wrapper on Windows and a symlink on unix.)
Improved test-markdown target in Makefile: + Use 'hsmarkdown' instead of building 'pandoc-strict' (which was a hack,   and didn't work on Windows machines, anyway, due to the line ending problem) + Put top-level directory in path before running the test script, so that   hsmarkdown can find 'pandoc' even if it hasn't been installed.
Modified main 'pandoc' program so that if it is called with program name = 'hsmarkdown' (e.g. through a symlink, on a system with real symbolic links), it will translate markdown to HTML in strict mode and interpret all command-line options as arguments, like Markdown.pl.
CSS changes for website.
Fixed a bug in website generation, which only worked if 'pandoc' and the wrappers had been installed.
Added fuller package descriptions to debian/control.
Moved hsmarkdown to src/wrappers/hsmarkdown.in, so it works with our existing build process.  There's no harm in having it be a template, even though there's nothing to fill it.
Added 'hsmarkdown' wrapper, designed to be used as a drop-in replacement for Markdown.pl.  It calls pandoc with the options '--from markdown --to html --strict' and disallows other options. (Any command-line options will be interpreted as arguments.)
Added package URL to Pandoc.cabal.in.
Documented change of 'HtmlEntities' to 'Entities' in changelog.
Change 'HtmlEntities' module to 'Entities'.  Adjusted calling code accordingly.
Use entities for all characters above 127 in docbook output. Though XML tools should support unicode, some people will be using SGML tools, and these do not.  Using entities makes the docbook files more portable.
Changed representation of code blocks to use <screen> and escaped characters rather than <programlisting> and CDATA. Reason:  XML source more easily editable and readable.
Changed description in debian/control to include docbook writer.
Inserted a needed slash in  the Makefile, after $(osx_pkg_name), which is the name of a directory!
Modified changelog to bring up to date.
Removed a line that was causing a compiler warning in docbook writer.  The line isn't necessary, since we have a case for every kind of block element.
Added docbook writer to list of exposed modules in Pandoc.cabal.in.
Merged changes from docbook branch since r363.
Refactored fillTemplates.pl.
Added a note to pandoc(1) man page about the differences between standard markdown and Pandoc's markdown-variant.
Revised inline code parsing in Markdown reader to conform to Markdown.pl.  Now any number of `'s can begin inline code, which will end with the same number of `'s.  For example, to have two backticks as code, write ``` `` ```
Documented makefile targets in INSTALL.
Simplified list parsing code in RST reader.
Added instructions for using the GHC profiler.
Cleaned up some code in RST reader.
Changed Markdown reader so that the first pass, in which a list of reference keys is made, is much faster.  This gets us a big performance boost.
Removed unneeded 'do' block from 'parseBlocks' definition in Markdown reader.
Changed usage message so that it is more compact (and slightly less informative).  It's important that it be able to fit on one screen.
Documented the "blank line before  header and block quote" discrepancy between standard markdown and pandoc.
Updates to changelog for --strict option and other changes from the last revision.
Merged 'strict' branch from r324.  This adds a '--strict' option to pandoc, which forces it to stay as close as possible to official Markdown syntax.
Slight changes in website target: + history.html -> changelog.html + demo.html -> examples.html + Added title to changelog.html + Removed header div on html pages + Changed widths in css
Changed date on README.
Print command-line to stderr when making demo page.
Make wrappers executable in the top-level directory, in case people want to try them in place without installing.
+ Renamed web/demos.sh to mkdemos.sh + Added parameter for directory containing executables + Changed arithmetic statement for portability. + Modified Makefile accordingly.
Minor changes to changelog.
Modified changelog to bring up to date.
Revised uninstall-pandoc with new wrapper names.
+ Changed 'web2markdown' to 'html2markdown'.
Reversed changes from r246: + Removed invisible anchors in front of header tags in HTML output.   Reason:  no way to prevent duplicate ID attributes (which is invalid   HTML), since there might be duplicate header titles.  See   http://six.pairlist.net/pipermail/markdown-discuss/2005-January/000975.html.
Added two more demo cases to website.  Put a footnote in README for demonstration purposes.
Added a latex -> markdown case to demos.
Added another demo case, with header and footer and css.
Added "Demos" page to the website.
+ Removed the convenience symlinks (which don't work on Windows under   Cygwin, due to Windows' lack of true symbolic links). + Modified the wrappers to use 'pandoc' instead of the symlinks. + Modified the Makefile to remove all references to the symlinks. + Removed code from Main.hs that made pandoc's behavior depend on the   name of the calling program. + Added code to Main.hs that sets default reader and writer based on   extensions of input and output filenames (if provided).  (Thanks to   roktas for the idea.) + Modified README and man pages accordingly. + Removed WINDOWS-README target from Makefile.  It is no longer needed   now that we don't have the symlinks.
Added README-WINDOWS.html to windows package documentation.
+ Added --strip-trailing-cr option to diff in runtests.pl, so that   the test suite will work in Windows. + Converted some CR's to LF's in print.css and adjusted test suite   accordingly.
Changed default ASCIIMathML text color to black.
+ Updates to Makefile:   - New win-pkg target to build Windows binary package.   - Changed name on OSX package.   - New RELNAME global variable contains release name, e.g. pandoc-0.3   - Mac dmg is now created in top-level directory, not .. + Updates to website:   - Changed download links to point to Google Code downloads area.   - Added section on Windows binary package.
Add rst2markdown to dh_strip exclude list.
Pandoc package didn't contain 'pandoc' executable.  This is because we're using "Simply expanded variables" and PROGS expands before EXECS.  Put PROGS after EXECS to fix this bug.  As an alternative solution, we could make PROGS -and possibly others- "recursively expanded" variables, but I tend to avoid using that flavour of variables.
Fix the version of Debian packages, it should be "0.3" now.
Lintian complains as follows:
Changed osx-pkg target in Makefile to refer to COPYRIGHT instead of (obsolete) LICENSE.
Merged changes from branches/wrappers since r177. Summary of main changes: + Added -o/--output and -d/--debug options to pandoc. + Modified pandoc to behave differently depending on the name   of the program.  For example, if the program name is 'html2latex',   the default reader will be html and the default writer latex. + Removed most of the old wrappers, replacing them with symlinks   to pandoc. + Rewrote markdown2pdf and created a new wrapper web2markdown,   with the functionality of the old html2markdown script.  These   new scripts exploit pandoc's -d option to avoid having to do   complex command-line parsing. + Revised man pages and documentation appropriately.
Removed README-WINDOWS.  Instead, we'll have the Makefile tailor README to Windows (removing references to the wrappers, for example).
Added README-WINDOWS with instructions to be included with the binary distribution of Pandoc.  Still to be completed. Perhaps this should also be hidden in a subdirectory eventually.
Removed some stray characters (form feeds?) from COPYING.
Added to COPYRIGHT a note that the source code is available from the website, and a link.  This is necessary for GPL compliance in binary distributions (as far as I can see).
Removed TODO.  ToDo list now maintained on the Wiki at pandoc's Google Code site.  (Also in the repository:  wiki/ToDo.wiki.)
+ Added regression tests with footnotes in quote blocks and lists. + This uncovered an existing bug in the RTF writer, which got indentation   wrong on footnotes occuring in indented blocks like lists.  Fixed   this bug.
Fixed a serious bug in the Markdown reader (also affecting LaTeX and RST readers).  The problem:  these readers ran 'runParser' on processed chunks of text to handle embedded block lists in lists and quotation blocks.  But then any changes made to the parser state in these chunks was lost, as the state is local to the parser. So, for example, footnotes didn't work in quotes or list items.
Fixed two small haddock bugs.
Added license text to top of source files.
Changed 'stability' from 'provisional' to 'alpha'.
Added some extra fields to Pandoc.cabal.in.
Changed 'status' in comment headers from 'unstable' to 'provisional' (which seems to be the term that is used in this context).
Made javascript obfuscation of emails even more obfuscatory, by combining it with entity obfuscation.
Put notice about the GPL on web page.
+ Added module data for haddock. + Reformatted code consistently.
Obscured email addresses in documents that will be web-accessible.
Modified debian/copyright, and made COPYRIGHT in top level a symlink to it, to avoid duplication.
Removed LICENSE, replacing it with COPYING (text of GPL) and COPYRIGHT (including copyright information and licenses for other packages used).  Modified Pandoc.cabal.in and README accordingly.
Cleaned up TODO file.
Modified the HTML writer to add invisible anchors to each section heading.  The anchors are derived form the text of the section heading as described in README.  This makes it easy to insert links that jump from one part of a document to another: for example, '[back to the Introduction](#Introduction)'.
+ Replaced 'comparing' combinator in markdown reader with 'compare'.   'comparing' is from Data.Ord, which is not available in GHC 6.4. + Added line break after </li> in HTML footnote output, for easier   inspection of the source.
Fixed a minor mistake introduced in resolving conflicts from the merge.
Merged changes to footnotes branch r219-r240.
Added 'clean' target to src/templates/Makefile, main Makefile's 'clean' calls it to clean out template-generated files.
Changes to build process relating to r234. + Corrected dependencies in Makefiles to ensure that templates   get filled when the relevant files are modified. + Changed template placeholders to @xxx@ instead of <xxx>,   for consistency with our practice with the Cabal template. + Changed default font for RTF writer (this had been changed earlier,   but in the target rather than the template!)
Removed three files from the repository.  These are generated from templates in src/templates, and so should not be in the repository.
Changed footnote syntax to conform to the de facto standard for markdown footnotes.  References are now like this[^1] rather than like this^(1).  There are corresponding changes in the footnotes themselves.  See the updated README for more details.
Changed '--smartypants' to '--smart' and adjusted documentation and symbols accordingly.
+ BUGS now contains a link to pandoc's issue tracker at Google Code. + Modified TODO.
Removed a / in a comment that was causing haddock to fail.
Modified markdown reader to allow ordered list items to begin with (single) letters, as well as numbers.  The list item marker may now be terminated either by '.' or by ')'.  These extensions to standard markdown are documented in README.
+ Small changes to Makefile for better handling of Windows executable. + Added windows executable to the website target.
Improvements to smart-quote regexs.  Now we can better handle cases where latex commands or HTML entity references appear after quotes.
Changed 'putStrLn' to 'putStr' in Main.hs, and modified some of the readers to make spacing at end of output more consistent. Modified tests accordingly.
Bumped version to 0.3 after tagging 0.22.
Changed version to 0.22 for tag creation.
Makefile now checks to see if we're running Cygwin/Windows; if we are, '.exe' extension is added to each executable in EXECS.
Reverted addition of .exe to Windows executables in cabalize. It seems that Cabal does not expect these extensions.  Better to handle this in the Makefile.
In cabalize, add '.exe' extension to executables if we're on Windows/Cygwin.
Extract version number from src/Main.hs in cabalize and Makefile. The authoritative version number is now in src/Main.hs, with no duplication.  (This seems a better solution than building Main.hs from a template.)
Minor change: 'test 4' to 'test 3' in testwrapper.in.
+ Documented website target in changelog. + Added list of ideas/projects to TODO.
Revised changelog to reflect changes since r105.
Merge changes in branches/wrappers into trunk.
In HTML writer, include <title></title> even if title is null.
Minor improvements to LaTeX reader: + added nullBlock to preamble parsing, so we can handle unusual   things like pure TeX + modified escapedChar to allow a \ at the end of line to count   as escaped whitespace + treat "thanks" commands as footnotes
Refactored LaTeX reader for clarity (added isArg function).
Pandoc bug fixes: + LaTeX reader did not parse metadata correctly.  Now the title,   author, and date are parsed correctly, and everything else in   the preamble is skipped. + Simplified parsing of LaTeX command arguments and options.   The function commandArgs now returns a list of arguments OR   options (in whatever order they appear).  The brackets are   included, and a new stripFirstAndLast function is provided   to strip them off when needed.  This fixes a problem in dealing   with \newcommand, etc. + Added a "try" before "parser" in definition of notFollowedBy'   combinator.  Adjusted the code using this combinator accordingly. + Changed handling of code blocks.  Previously, some readers allowed   trailing newlines, while others stripped them.  Now, all readers   strip trailing newlines in code blocks; writers insert a newline   at the end of code blocks as needed. + Changed test suite to reflect these changes.
Modified INSTALL instructions to emphasize that GNU make is required, and that it goes by the name 'gmake' on some systems.
Using hardcoded executable paths in Makefile doesn't work.  While GHC 6.6 Cabal builds executables in dist/build/$executable, older Cabal versions use dist/build/src.  To cope with this situation: + Revert to old code which determines executable paths dynamically. + Create symlinks to the compiled executables in top directory.  Make sure   to not touch symlinks once they've been created. + As PROGS variable can now contain symlinks, determine the actual file   during installation. + Replace EXECNAMES with EXECS, as the former became a redundant name due   to these changes.
Modified markdown2pdf to check that input file exists and is readable, and error exit if not.
Fixed bug with 'shift' in html2markdown and markdown2pdf.
Remove ' -- ' prefix instead of '--' in passed-through options.
Changes to man files documenting the ' -- ' option.
Minor documentation changes (README).
Better error messages in markdown2pdf:  print only the latex errors, not the whole log file.
* Add PANDOC_OPTS support to 'markdown2pdf'.
README changes: + Added documentation for '-- ' in shell scripts. + Added section on ucs.sty and LaTeX.
Modified wrapper scripts to pass all command-line options after -- to pandoc.  These options override the environment variable PANDOC_OPTS, if it is set.  (Note:  these changes don't include changes to the documentation or man pages, or to markdown2pdf.)
Replace which(1) in all wrappers with 'pathfind', a POSIX-compliant shell function.  Expand tabs to four spaces.
Fix a bug in 'uninstall-exec' target.
Portability fixes and various cleanups in wrapper scripts: + Fix the tests at the header of wrappers.  which(1) doesn't behave as   expected on some systems.  We should only assume that it's pretty widely   available (for example, it's a builtin in csh) and we should only rely on   its exit code by ignoring its output. + Replace 'echo -n' with 'printf' as the latter is recommended. + In markdown2pdf script, '--suffix' and '--backup' options of mv(1) appear   to be GNU-ism.  Apply a workaround. + Wrap some long lines to fit in an 80-column screen. + Remove spaces at the line ends.
Made wrapper scripts sensitive to PANDOC_OPTS environment variable, which may contain command-line options to be passed to pandoc. + Changed the scripts themselves, including $PANDOC_OPTS after 'pandoc' + Added ENVIRONMENT to man pages for wrappers + Formatting changes to man files + Added description of PANDOC_OPTS to README
Changes to OSX packaging: + Use $(NAME) instead of hard-coded 'Pandoc' for package and dmg names + Create dmg in .. (like debs) + Modified website target to get dmg from ..
Use compiled executables directly from their build directory, without copying them to the top directory.
Fix a serious bug in Makefile.  'make' should recompile when a source file has been modified.
Fixed two small Haddock comment bugs in Shared.hs.
Changed first two paragraphs of index.txt to match README.
Remove signatures (and emails!) from changelog on web page.
+ Changes to osx/Welcome:   - removed hardcoded references to /usr/local   - added title + Minor changes to website build process.
Revisions to website target: + added link for OSX package + minor fixes
Put all website commands into a subshell jail.  If any command failed, we would end up with web_dest directory which would have to be removed manually for further attempts.  If this looked ugly; as an alternative solution we could change 'website' target as follows:
Changes for 'website': + Execute $(MAIN) in './' otherwise this would fail if $(MAIN) is not   available in PATH. + Make echo off during file checking. + Copy $(deb_main) from parent directory.
Changed install.html to INSTALL.html in website; replaced a reference to README.html to INSTALL.html.
Added target for creation of website.  'web' directory contains source files for website, which is created in 'web/pandoc'.
Removed INSTALL.html from build-doc target.
Fixes from last review: + Add markdown2pdf to %.pdf dependencies. + Make build-all target explicitly depend on build-program, instead of   'all' which might be changed in future. + Add build-program to osx-pkg-prep for the sake of explicitness. + Generate INSTALL.html in build-doc.
Modified INSTALL instructions; require "make build-all" before "make install-all".
Attempt to fix a (long-standing) Makefile drawback which is documented in previous revisions as follows:
Fix all the errors lintian(1) reported: + "SEE ALSO" sections of man files have paragraph fillings errors which   groff(1) complains ("cannot adjust line").  This is because .BR line in   "SEE ALSO" section is too long to break properly.  Fix all man pages.   While on it, move all AUTHORS section to the end of the files, this   section should come last. + lintian(1) complains about the debian/changelog symlink:     W: pandoc source: changelog-is-symlink     N:     N:   The file debian/changelog is a symlink instead of a regular file. This     N:   is unnecessary and makes package checking and manipulation more     N:   difficult. If the changelog should be available in the source package     N:   under multiple names, make debian/changelog the real file and the     N:   other names symlinks to it.     N:     N:   This problem may have prevented lintian from performing other checks,     N:   leading to undetected changelog errors.   Reverse the source and targets in symlink to fix this warning.  Now, the   Debian packages can be cleanly built.
Fix a bug in variable substitution.
Older Cabal versions have no '--destdir' option.  Detect the availability of this option and fallback to '--copy-prefix' (which is now deprecated, as of GHC 6.6).
Remove some code comments from previous commit.
More sanitizations in Makefile (needs testing): + Remove a bogus DOCS assignment line. + Cabal recreates pandoc executable by unnecessarily linking Main.o with   library (it skips compiling *.hs files though).  Since pandoc's time   stamp is modified, it is  copied from buildir to top directory, and also   README.html is regenerated, each time a target which has a 'build'   prerequisite is invoked.  As a solution, now PHONY 'build' target depends   on BUILDDIR/. + "THIS" variable has a confusing semantics and it is abusingly used in   various targets.  We in fact need it to specify package sub directories   created during installation.  Clarify this meaning by moving it to path   variables section. + Create a new variable as MAIN which holds the main executable name.   Sorry for my obsession to avoid simply using a magic "pandoc" name. :-)   Modify all targets which (abusingly) refers  to THIS and replace THIS   with MAIN.  Note that MAIN is derived from EXECS which in turn collects   all executable names from Executable stanzas in cabal file. + As EXECS may hold more than one executable name, update EXECS target to   reflect this semantic. + Rename BINS variable as PROGS and modify it so as to hold the names of   all executables required to be installed.  Remove bin_all local variable   as PROGS can be used for the same purpose instead. + Modify DOCS variable so as to hold the names of all documents required to   be installed.  Remove doc_all local variable as DOCS can be used for the   same purpose instead. + Remove DOCS target.  README.html is already generated when needed. + Remove build-exec redundant prerequisite from osx_dest target.  Make can   find its way. + Set MAIN as the prerequisite of 'test' and 'test-markdown' to make things   more clear.
Sanitize Makefile: + Move $(BINS) target to a new PHONY 'build-exec' target.  This should be   used in all (non-build type) targets which refer BINS.  Also, create a   new 'build-program' target for user's convenience. + Update all targets so as to use build-exec (instead of BINS). + Use an explicit global DOCS variable which lists buildable documents;   this makes our intention more clear.  Also, for the sake of consistency,   move BINS variable (which lists buildable executables) to a new section   and create a redundant (for the moment, at least) EXECS variable. + Move all buildable target files in install-* targets to the related   build-* targets.  This mostly involves document files (e.g. README.hmtl).   As a result, we now have a new build target 'build-doc' which builds main   documents.  This modification provides a clean separation between build   and install type targets.
Make osx-dmg target depend on $(osx_dmg_name), so that if the dmg file has already been built, it does not build it again.
Changes related to osx packaging: + Simplified osx-dmg target, which need not be built as root. + Made osx-pkg and osx-pkg-prep non-.PHONY, plus a few other minor   changes to make the dependencies work correctly. + Removed \< from the sed regex in cabalize; this is not support in   BSD sed. + Changed path information in osx/Welcome and message in uninstall-pandoc.
Changed version numbers to 0.3.
Created new changelog, made debian/changelog a symlink to changelog in top-level.
Removed check for presence of pandoc in uninstall-pandoc; if uninstall-pandoc is present, that means Pandoc is installed.
Various changes in osx-* targets. + Exit 1 if permissions are not satisfied. + Make all targets PHONY. + Minor cosmetic fixes.
Added uninstall-pandoc script to Mac OS X package. Added information about uninstalling to Welcome message.
Added uninstall-pandoc script for Mac OS X package.
Changes to osx-pkg and osx-dmg targets.
Improved osx-dmg and osx-pkg targets in Makefile.
Use iconv on output as well as input in wrapper scripts.
Improved man files for pandoc and all wrappers.
Renamed OSX-Welcome as Welcome.
Remove files from top-level that have been moved to osx directory.
Added osx directory for source files for Mac OS X package, to reduce clutter at top level.
+ Improved man page for pandoc and markdown2pdf. + Changed README to recommend iconv on both input and output. + Added TODO items.
Revert all changes related to automatic ChangeLog creation. + Remove ChangeLog and gnuify-changelog.pl + Remove 'package' target in Makefile.
Improvements to Mac OS X package build: + Add "pandoc" as bundle identifier to get rid of warning. + Remove old make_osx_pkg_dirs script, no longer needed because of   make target. + Add OSX-Welcome, with information about adding /usr/local/bin   to PATH. + Modify Makefile accordingly.
Improved osx-pkg target; added Info.plist and Description.plist.
Improved LaTeX writer's handling of dashes: + Recognize a double hyphen as an Em-dash, even when it occurs next   to punctuation (e.g. a quotation mark). + Collapse space around Em-dashes. + Process quotes before dashes.  This way (foo -- 'bar') will turn into   (foo---`bar') instead of (foo---'bar').
osx-pkg target: install into Package_root subdirectory of osx_dest.
+ Revert changes in 'deb' target, add new target 'package' instead.  This   target updates ChangeLog and then create packages. + Minor fix 'ChangeLog' target, update ChangeLog.
Ensure that we have always up-to-date version of ChangeLog before creating a Debian package.  Make 'ChangeLog' target PHONY to force an update.
Make debian/rules executable to avoid errors in 'distclean' target.
Modifications to create a nice ChangeLog. + Add new file 'gnuify-changelog.pl' grabbed and adapted from subversion   distribution. + Add 'ChangeLog' target to create/update ChangeLog. + Update current ChangeLog.
Really fix cabal version detection.
Add pandoc executable to process rules as a dependency.  Make osx_dest, osx-pkg distinction more clear.
Parameterise "osx-pkg".
Add a 'osx-pkg' target for the creation of a Mac OSX® package (using PackageMaker.App).  This target recursively uses 'install-program' target to populate OSX package directory tree.
* cabalize: fix cabal version detection by using a bloody hack. * Makefile:   + Make 'uninstall-all' depends on 'uninstall-exec'.   + Make the default target 'all' depends on $(BINS).  Now, invoking     a plain 'make' builds and creates pandoc in the top directory.
Bug fixes to make_osx_pkg_dirs.
Added a script to make prepare directories for creation of a Mac OSX package (using PackageMaker.app).
* Extracted installation instructions from README into a separate file, INSTALL.  Reason:  Only those who install from source will need the information in INSTALL, so it does not need to be included in user documentation.  Indeed, it might confuse people who install Pandoc by some other method. * Minor changes in README (using "Pandoc" as a generic name for the system, "'pandoc'" as a name for the executable).
Changed date on README.
Added a comma in README.
Remove 'install-lib', it causes too much trouble which needs to be dealed in ugly ways. + Now, we have 'install-program' and 'install-all' targets.  The former   installs only program and user documents, while the latter installs   everything: program, user documents, library files and library documents. + Behaviour of 'install' target hasn't changed, it calls 'install-program'. + Update README accordingly. + Implement missing uninstall-* targets (including 'uninstall-all' and   'uninstall-program' for the new targets). + Call 'install-program' in debian/rules explicitly to prevent confusions.
Changes to RTF writer: + use Helvetica instead of Times New Roman as default font + specify \f0 in every \pard; otherwise font sizes are not registered properly + modify test of RTF writer accordingly
Portability fix.  Remove rmdir(1)'s '--ignore-fail-on-non-empty' option, as it is unsupported in BSD version.  Note that the relevant line has already started with a '-' which means that make(1) will ignore any error.
+ Changed debian/copyright to reflect new website location.
Merge trunk with ghc66-branch.
Acknowledge roktas's contributions in README.
+ fixed html2markdown usage message, in which w3m occured twice + added usage documentation to beginning of fillTemplates.pl
Minor corrections.
Add "-o | --output" option to markdown2pdf, update man file.
Wording changes in man files.
Minor wording change in README.
Modified package descriptions in debian/control.
Give full download URL in debian/copyright.
Fixed jgm's email address in debian changelog.
Minor corrections and improvements to README.
* Fix man files installation so that we really ignore .svn directories. * Remove $datadir/doc/pandoc on uninstall-doc.  Only this directory is   removed since it's a cruft directory due to its name. I couldn't find   a reliable method to remove other directories created on installation. * Use fakeroot when invoking dpkg-buildpackage.  Improve warnings in   'deb' target.
Added markdown2html to bin_all.
As we are using subversion, ignore '.svn' directories when building debs.
initial import
Initial directory structure.
